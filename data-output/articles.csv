It explores the ‘marriage premium’, which refers to the advantage that children born to married parents have in comparison to other parental arrangements, and also highlights change in the ‘marriage premium’ after 1989. The analysis also examines the effect of marriage timing: Does the marriage premium differ between pre-birth and post-birth marriages? Did the effect of timing also change after 1989? The analysis is based on Czech GGS (Generations and Gender Survey) data from 2005. Direct marriages are the most stable unions, cohabitations are the least stable. Among couples who were not married, the odds of dissolution increased by 142 per cent (in comparison to marriages without pre-marital cohabitation). This ‘marriage premium’ increased after 1989. Marriage timing has come to play an increasingly important role. In the pre-1989 marriage cohort, pre-birth and post-birth marriage had the same stabilising effect. After 1989, however, pre-delivery wedding stabilises unions more than post-delivery legitimising marriages. We conclude that the era of highly individualised partnership choices has clearly shone a light on the consequences of these choices for subsequent union stability.","marriage, cohabitation, coresident partnership, union instability",czech,Partnership,marriage - partnership - family - gender - division - transitions - partners - status - families - sociodemographic,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7676287008690194,0,0,0,0,0,11.566116,6.626192

In the 1980–1989 marriage cohort, the risk of divorce was 3.7 times higher among children of divorced parents than among children whose parents did not divorce. In the most recent marriage cohort (1990–2005), the parental divorce effect weakened but was still significant: children of divorced parents experienced a divorce risk that was twice as high that of children from intact families.

We also pose these questions separately for the public and private spheres, for selected industries, and for workplaces according to size. Throughout the monitored period, the GPG for equal work is around 10% and another roughly one-half of total GPG is caused by gender segregation. There has been a slight decrease since 2018, especially in workplaces with more than 5000 employees, where, however, the significance of women’s segregation into lower-paid positions is growing. The research confirmed that in more regulated, and therefore more transparent, contexts, such as the public sphere and in large workplaces (but also in small companies with up to 50 employees), the GPG for equal work is smaller than elsewhere. The results point to the need to systematically monitor the GPG and increase the transparency of remuneration systems in the workplace. In connection with the GPG, it will also be necessary to analyse the organisational processes that lead to women’s segregation into occupations, workplaces, and jobs that have lower wages, as well as the growing precarity of the Czech labour market.","gender wage gap, equal wage for equal work, gender segregation, wage transparency, linked employer–employee data",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.917671,6.2984424

Research on 124 studies on this subject revealed that there are three main themes associated with maternal health in this context: (1) How women are defined and categorised as migrants: This is often based on a single indicator, country of origin or birth. This creates a simplified and homogenising category that then also serves as the basis for the use of more complex categories. (2) The significance of social support for families, especially with respect to informal care, and the fundamental role of language and language barriers in health care. The relationship between migrant women and health-care providers is impacted by cultural differences, which leave women in a vulnerable position. (3) Macro-sociological and epidemiological factors.

The authors analyse these dimensions using data from two representative sociological surveys. 1) The right to be a parent (to care for one's child) and the right to work: the measures provided in the Czech welfare state are based on the myth that there are two separate worlds of work and care in conformity with the gender principle, even though there are no significant differences between Czech men and women in terms of the value of work in their lives. 2) Equality or non-discrimination in parenthood: the right to work of mothers of young children is violated in the context of generally increasing gender inequalities in the labour market. 3) The opportunity to achieve a work/life balance: in Czech society flexible forms of employment are uncommon, working hours tend to have a fixed start and finish, or there is negative flexibility, which renders a work/life balance impossible. The way in which state policy defines and employers apply the conditions of parenthood in relation to the labour market and in the context of the gender structure of Czech society makes parenthood a significant handicap for the social inclusion of women who are mothers of young children in the Czech Republic.","gender equality, gender and labor market, work/life balance, parenthood, flexible forms of employment, Czech Republic.",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,TRUE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.944304,5.964864

Do hostels house the more disadvantaged segment of the disadvantaged population, such as the inhabitants of SELs? Our aim is to produce a more nuanced understanding of the different needs of the heterogeneous population of socially excluded localities, which can be used to implement socially inclusive measures. We analyse data obtained in a survey of the population of SELs. We apply binary logistic regression using socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of respondents and their households and variables measuring victimisation and respondents’ risk behaviour as predictors. Along with descriptive statistics we present the results of the simple and multiple binary logistic regressions. The multiple model revealed the following predictors to be statistically significant: the share of rent in household income, household size, residential mobility, citizenship, labour status, criminal activity not punished by imprisonment, nationality/ethnicity, and property victimisation of the household.

Empirically, the study draws on the author's long-term experience conducting fieldwork in socially excluded localities, mainly in the socially excluded locality Havířov-Šumbark. The study concludes that insecurity cannot be reduced to just the issue of crime or violence, as existing scholarship has done. An element of insecurity in socially excluded localities is also represented by territorial stigmatisation and structural victimisation, that is, fear of the consequences of symbolic pollution and declining living standards or low social status. Symbolic stigmatisation and structural victimisation have a constraining effect on how inhabitants of excluded localities live their everyday lives, albeit in different ways than street crime does.","insecurity, socially excluded localities, physical violence, street crime, territorial stigmatisation, structural victimisation",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.15187973648028694,0.06828462156277727,0,0.05041419398501242,0,0.05663663136028245,0,0,8.270896,4.152807

Our study was conducted in the Czech Republic, a CEE country where sexual minorities face strong legal and social barriers to non-heterosexual parenthood. In an online survey (N = 882) conducted in 2019 among self-identified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual people with same-sex attraction, we found a considerable gap in parenting desires by sexual identity. Parenting desires are weaker among homosexuals, especially men, while bisexuals are closer to heterosexuals in their parenting desires. Our research suggests that in the context of discussions of parenthood Czech women are unwilling to identify as lesbians and opt instead to claim a different sexual identity. Our findings indicate that the structural barriers to parenthood thus play a much more important role than the overall liberal-minded atmosphere in the Czech Republic.","parenting desires, sexual identities, LGB individuals, Czech Republic/Czechia, CEE country, survey methodology",english,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.376671,5.3140907

Understood in evaluative terms, political trust has often been linked to the performance of the state and its institutions. The macrolevel sources of trust, however, are not well understood owing to the scarcity of empirical tests beyond cross-sectional analyses. This paper examines economic performance and the quality of governance as determinants of political trust in Europe. The analysis relies on data from the European Values Study and the World Values Survey between 1990 and 2019, covering 42 European countries surveyed at least twice. The modelling strategy explicitly distinguishes between-country variation from within-country variation in macrolevel characteristics, enabling the examination of cross-national and longitudinal effects. The results provide evidence of associations between economic performance – economic development and unemployment – and political trust in the expected directions, with some differences across European regions. Further, countries with less corruption tend to enjoy higher political trust, but the effects of changes in the level of corruption on trust depend on the corruption indicator used. Finally, improvements in the quality of electoral democracy are associated with declines in political trust.","political trust, public opinion, institutional performance, economic development, unemployment, democracy, corruption, cross-national research",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0.1166016875036672,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05741323292942609,0,4.0874643,4.6192174

While this movement has mainly spread to Anglophone countries, it is almost entirely absent from Eastern Europe and the Czech Republic in particular. The aim of this paper is to explain why the Transition movement—a grassroots community initiative—has not been successfully adopted in the post-socialist Czech Republic, and why the issue of climate change has not become an important frame for the local permaculture movement which introduced the idea of Transition to the country. The paper presents an analysis of ideological frames and framing processes of the local movement. Reasons identified for the movement’s absence from the Czech Republic include the fact that it was largely overshadowed by the broader post-socialist transformation in Eastern Europe, that there was little public awareness of climate change and no real culture of community organising in the post-socialist period, and that a strong climate scepticism was promoted by Czech political elites. Other reasons relate to the ideological frames of the local permaculture movement, which is centred more on prognostic and mobilising frames, combined with a positive agenda and an emphasis on practical activities, and revolves around individualised strategies and frames in which permaculture and a nature religion (Anastasian spirituality) are linked to the concept of a ‘family homestead’.

This article focuses on perceptions and constructions of sexual harassment by students and the gap between students' individual definitions and expert (mainly legislative) definitions of sexual harassment. The article centres on two main research questions: (1) how do students perceive sexual harassment (whether they construct sexual harassment as something they might encounter in everyday university life) and (2) what are the factors and dimensions that contribute to particular behaviour being labelled as sexual harassment? The study is based primarily on qualitative in-depth interviews with students, which are complemented by quantitative questionnaire data from a survey conducted between 2008 and 2009 at a Prague university. The analysis shows that even if sexual harassment by professors is not an uncommon phenomenon among students, it is constructed as a remote problem which students perceive as something that does not relate to them. Although students do not label their experience of sexist and sexualised behaviour as sexual harassment, the analysis reveals certain factors which result in the labelling of certain behaviour as sexual harassment.The most signifi cant among these factors were the explicit nature ofsexual harassment, power imbalance, situational context and the violation of individual boundaries.","sexual harassment, higher education, anti-harassment policy, Czech Republic",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.05998649023583256,0,0,0.05570055366715931,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06130156467277471,9.174218,5.4948673

Teachers with small children consequently faced a number of emotional dilemmas that primarily stemmed from the conflict between their role as a teacher and their role as a parent, which unfolded in the home as the one and only space in which to perform work, family care, and self-care. The paper is organised around the question of why teachers in this difficult situation did not take advantage of child sick leave, a public policy measure that could have helped them to reduce this conflict and to care for their children and their own mental health. In this study we draw on research into the emotional dimensions of public policies, micropolicies and micropolitics, and the self-conception of teachers. The analysis is based on a data sample of public policy documents, interviews with nine teachers, and discussion threads in a public Facebook group dedicated to teachers. We found that the main reasons teachers did not take child sick leave were their emotionally strongly sense of the imperatives attached to their self-conception as a teacher and supported by the micropolitics of schools, and their perception of child sick leave as representing uncertainty and failure rather than relief. Child sick leave has moreover been recognised as a public policy measure that is anchored in the modern separation of the public (work) and the private (family, care) spheres, which in the conditions of the pandemic crisis revealed its limitations.","care, teachers, emotions, micropolicies, micropolitics, self-concept, pandemic, child sick leave",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0.06465248759824778,0,0,0.1332676956562637,0,0,0.05427576086017814,0,0,0,0,0.0712504281031269,10.741394,5.415497

In the field of education, this involved closing schools and the continuation of education at home. In the Czech Republic, schools first closed in March 2021; the school closures lasted, with a few interruptions, for more than a year. Some educational functions that were traditionally performed by schools were temporarily transferred to parents of school-age children. This fact was a challenge for both schools and families and led to a temporary change in the distribution of educational responsibilities between the school and the family. From March to September 2021, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with the parents of children in primary schools who participated in their children's education during the school closures. The data were analysed by means of a thematic analysis. The aim of the study was to shed light on the nature of parents' educational involvement, describe new pedagogical aspects of parenthood that were not a part of it before the mass introduction of remote learning, and understand the reconfiguration of the relationship between school and family. The analysis of the data showed that the transfer of some educational responsibilities onto the shoulders of parents led to a quantitative and qualitative expansion of 'pedagogical' interventions in society, the (auto) didacticisation of parental identities, and a strengthening of parents' ability to engage in pedagogical reflexivity.","Czech Republic, school closures, remote learning, family, COVID-19",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0.0637535700504219,0,0,0.12957554357237466,0,0,0.0535023610745052,0,0,0,0,0.07038861704282501,10.71465,5.421989

The article draws on data from a questionnaire survey of first- and second-year students at Charles University in 2017 (n = 5127) and conducts a multiple correspondence analysis. It shows that the first dimension of the cultural space of students can be interpreted as the axis of overall cultural capital without any specific differentiation. The third dimension of cultural space, by contrast, convincingly captures a cleavage between traditional cultural capital and a new form of cultural capital. The amount of cultural capital accumulated depends on the kind of academic disciplines studied, but another significant structuring element of cultural capital is the environment of individual university faculties itself.","cultural capital, legitimate culture, taste, education, multiple correspondence analysis",czech,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.06167555607038223,0,0,0.49692510369445536,0,0,0,0,7.910164,5.119194

There are some areas of contradiction between the three spaces: the negative descriptions by the dominant actors versus the social practices (e.g. pooling, borrowing) and strong social relationships in the Hilton, the seemingly irrational patterns of exploitation of the Hilton, the contrast between the filth outside the building and the clean state of the rooms, i.e. between chaos and order, the disparate views taken of dogs that live in the Hilton too, and ecological and hygienic problems, and so on. The negative view taken by local residents generates a fear of the homeless, which partly legitimises the ritual police inspects of the Hilton, and puts the public in the paradoxical position of both wanting to solve the problem, but rejecting the available tools to do so.","homelessness, trialectics of spatiality, heterotopia, dominant actors, social production of space",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.5781875,3.6783552

This perspective provides better insight into contemporary neoliberal technologies of social control and the related technology of social control in general, examples of which in various social sectors are then provided by the authors in the article. The education sector must also be understood in the context of neoliberal governmentality, which casts in a new light many educational strategies that are generally accepted without question. The strategy of lifelong education must then be released from its representation as a natural right and instead included among the strategies of social coercion and domination directed at the inter-institutionalisation of education. Equally, it is also possible to expose debunk the skills-based concept of 'enterprise curriculum' that blurs the difference between general and professional education as a neoliberal power strategy. The results of the failure to apply this perspective to the education sector are the unchallenged ideologisation of contemporary education discourse and the formation of educational strategies that generate many undesirable consequences.","governmentality studies, neoliberalism, self-entrepreneur, enterprise curriculum, lifelong learning.",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.13059205616372194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.009915,6.5548615

The government of the Czech Republic did not introduce any special measures to address this during any of the lockdowns or as part of any counter-pandemic measures. To interpret the analysis, we deploy a conceptualisation of ignorance. Ignorance in the area of domestic violence is reflected in the inconsistency of the system of assistance, and this was observed during the pandemic as well. Ignorance is shown to be integral to the system of assistance to domestic violence survivors and a key factor in its efficiency.

Our ethnographic research describes the lockdown technologies used at Home F, a residential institution for people identified as disabled. Setting out from the assumption that freedom is not the antithesis of some united regulatory regime but is the result of the intersection of various repertoires and logics of influence, the research analyses the 'passages' that regulate relations between the clients and their surroundings before and during the pandemic. It shows that the regulatory mechanisms that were put in place to facilitate an effective pandemic response do not constitute a new apparatus but only an intensification of technologies already in place. With the aim of mitigating risk, they delegitimise the needs of clients, render relations dependent on obedience, and pass moralised judgements on behaviour. Such 'pedagogical arrangements' cause emotional suffering and do not leave much space for freedom.

The results show that, even though the work ethic decreased in the Czech Republic and increased in Slovakia, intergenerational population replacement contributed to its weakening in both countries. Furthermore, the results indicate that the reason this process dominated the overall trend in the Czech Republic but not that in Slovakia may be the historical differences in levels of socioeconomic development and the different paces of population replacement. Finally, tentative evidence in favour of modernisation theory is presented, indicating that population replacement universally contributed to a decrease in the work ethic in all the other European countries with comparable EVS data.","work ethic, work orientations, modernisation theory, linear decomposition, European Values Study.",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.08227051977702814,0,0,0.0827850642345044,0,0,0.0640111417651846,0,0,0,0,0.12206545870166588,10.377235,7.0281177

In the first part of the article, we make three critical gestures together with José, a person identified as mentally ill. A paranoid vision of a secret conspiracy, a naturalising concept of disease, and the critique of stigma all seek to radically redraw the dis/ability coordinates, but their emancipatory potential is thwarted by the complex interconnectedness of their objects. José's recovery thus ultimately hinges on a delicate balancing act combining critique and composing. In this sense, his effort resembles the careful treading of lay and professional critics in the last part of our text, in which we try to solve problems of living with dementia together with the Hanuš family.

This is one reason why the authors decided to use the Republic of Venice to study the relationship between the social and physical space and chart the ways in which social inequalities at the dawn of the modern era were reflected in the organisation of the urban space. They present Venice as 'two cities in one': Venice the city built and portrayed from the perspective of the privileged classes, i.e. the viewpoint of those who had themselves transported through the city on gondolas; and Venice the city of the pedestrian traffic of the lower classes, excluded from political life. The authors set out to attain a better understanding of the deep social and political inequalities that existed in Venice on the one hand and of how it endured a thousand years of internal political stability without experiencing a single attempt at revolt, revolution or social uprising on the other. They therefore focus not just on forms of stratification, segregation and exclusion, but also on how Venetian society integrated its marginalised members and how it accorded them social and cultural relevance and recognition.","socio-spatial structures, social inequalities, Venice, Renaissance, carnival",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.48878931495908273,0.07453425723170493,0,0.07224015911171558,0.06140153551275409,0.05683572416632375,0,0,7.4382486,3.466954

The separation of the Roma from the majority occurs both in the social space and in the educational system through the existence of sub-standard, low-demanding basic schools, where the majority of students are Roma. Both spatial and educational exclusion have become the subject of public debate, policies, and, in the case of schools, of international legal disputes. In the article the authors ask what mechanisms lie behind the existence/functioning of 'Roma schools' in the vicinity of deprived urban enclaves with Roma populations. To answer this question they introduce the concept of ethnically segmented local education markets, which emerged in large cities after 1989. These markets interconnect deprived Roma localities with 'Roma schools' and are a part of the wider problem of the low social mobility of segregated urban Roma. The authors show that the ethnically segmented education market is shaped by three factors: (a) the spatial structure, (b) the institutional framework, including law and policy as well as schools, and (c) the educational strategies of both Roma and non-Roma parents. The data the authors used in the analysis came from the Czech part of an international quantitative and qualitative study in which more than 920 questionnaires were completed by students and teachers and 80 interviews were conducted with students, parents and teachers in two large Czech cities. For a better understanding of the authors' basic argument they chose just one segmented local market as an illustrative example.","social exclusion, Roma, education, socially excluded localities, reproduction of social and spatial inequality, education market, Czech Republic.",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0.07886179674020252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.9294953,3.4122205

This article aims to study how spatial exclusion and involuntary residential segregation 'function', that is, how they operate on the social micro level as a 'generator' of social and economic disadvantage. Certain types of objective obstacles arise in the living environment of excluded people and they continuously have to overcome these obstacles on an everyday basis. The author analyses how spatial exclusion acts on the excluded by requiring relatively high expenditures of money and time for them to overcome exclusion. He then examines the infrastructural dimensions of spatial exclusion, describing infrastructural exclusion as a dimension of disadvantage in which the excluded have limited access to infrastructures and through them resources otherwise commonly accessible in the dominant socio-economic system. Access to these infrastructures and resources can be regarded as an indicator of social integration and as an essential precondition for equal and meaningful social and economic participation in the life of the dominant socio-economic system.

We also examine what connection existed between role conflicts and the quality of a partnership. To answer these questions we analysed data from the 'Czech GGS Covid Pilot Study' from December 2020 and found that working frequently from home was associated with more frequent work-family conflict. Respondents experienced more problems performing their family role (e.g. they were too tired to do housework) than their role as an employee. As the intensity of work from home increased, however, respondents tended to report more frequent problems performing their role as an employee (e.g. family responsibilities made it difficult for them to concentrate on work). The association between working from home and work-family conflict differed significantly depending on the gender and the presence of children in the household. For men and parents of children under the age of 15, working from home was more significantly associated with work-family conflict. People who often experienced work-family conflict also more often considered breaking up with their partner. Working from home thus became a significant stressor for family life during the pandemics.","working from home, Covid-19, Generations and Gender Survey, work-family conflict, partnership quality",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0.08819535070420036,0,0.05623525519576378,0.32812284722520046,0,0,0.0872923750839249,0,0,0,0,0.10742199254799986,10.604286,6.0821586

Drawing on specific examples from the field, the author argues that competition, the use of objects, appearance, emotions, and charisma during a ballroom performance are all socially created, actively reconstructed through social interaction, and shaped by institutional rules. The social context of those actions, which is formed by institutionalisation, high competition, and the aesthetics of the upper social classes, produces a specific approach to the body: treating it as an efficient tool to obtain social status. This tool requires both sharpening (strategies for constructing its effectiveness) and polishing (strategies concerned with aesthetics and transforming one's appearance). The conclusions of the research include the finding that ballroom dancing involves the direct embodiment of cultural norms and the subordination of the human body to the ideas of the bourgeois classes. The above insights are based on data collected during a six-year ethnographic study in the social subworld of competitive ballroom dancing.","ballroom dance, sport-sociological perspective, body, institutionalised competition, social aspects of leisure",english,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.62474,4.057817

The first school closure in the spring of 2020 was perceived as a rather positive opportunity to step outside the course of everyday life. However, as the pandemic continued, the long-term negative effects that the increased care duties during lockdown had on people and especially mothers became apparent: a worsening labour market position, a deteriorating economic situation, and an increasing dependence of women on male breadwinners or on the social support system. The pandemic highlighted the paradox of reproductive work in late capitalism and showed how childcare has no market value in itself. Although in the first period of the pandemic parents experienced care to some extent as an opportunity, a source of meaning, and a rediscovered value, overall the pandemic did not lead to a greater recognition or valuation of care in society.","care, pandemic Covid-19, risk, gender, parenting",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0.0986346466941719,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05080526489040315,10.655346,5.326983

The analysis uses data from the Labour Force Study (LFS) collected in the fourth quarter of 2017 and focuses on people between the ages of 60 and 69 and five independent variables: gender, education, pension eligibility, marital status, and type of job. It studies how gender intersects with other characteristics in the decision to retire from the labour market. Although pension eligibility is the central predictor of economic inactivity after the age of 60, when eligibility is controlled for here, it is evident that gender, education, job type, and marital status all influence the timing of labour market exits. Women leave work earlier than men, and this is found to be true even when we control for their education or pension eligibility. They are also more likely than men to leave work even if they are not yet eligible to collect a pension. The effect of education is not as straightforward for women as for men: women with the lowest and with the highest levels of education are more likely to continue to work than men with the same educational attainment.

While attempting to explain the continuity and change of abortion institutions in the former Czechoslovakia /Czech Republic, the article focuses on the framing of the debates that preceded the changes in abortion legislation in the Czech Republic since the 1950s. Discourse analysis of media and expert articles, parliamentary debates, and other documents shows that abortion in the Czech Republic was framed as a medical issue since the 1950s, not an issue of women's rights or bodily citizenship. Gynaecologists were the most important actors in the abortion debates. The effect of this medicalised discourse of abortion was the construction of a specific knowledge on abortion. In spite of existing alternative discourses, this original discourse now hinders the possibility of reframing abortion in terms of women's reproductive rights and this is reflected in the status quo of the abortion legislation.

In this article the author focuses on the economic implications of lone motherhood and on the strategies that women living with children without a partner develop in order to ensure their livelihood. The author begins by presenting the theoretical background and some results from European and North American research on lone motherhood. She then provides an overview of research on lone parenthood done in the Czech Republic since 1959. Finally, the author describes the qualitative study she conducted on divorced mothers. The results show how women deal economically with marital separation and which livelihood strategies they opt for. The research methodology was based on constructivist grounded theory and the technique of interviews. From the research results the author distinguishes five basic strategies that can be combined and that are based on the sources that women have at their disposal. Those strategies may differ in terms of their degree of success, dependence/independence on others, and their efficacy at different points in time. The results also indicate that the success of these working strategies depends mainly on the age of the youngest child in the family and the caring responsibilities required by that age. The author argues that while for some women heading one-parent families paid work is an option that allows them to obtain a certain degree of independence and self-confidence, its efficacy depends on the context and immediate conditions in which the women find themselves. Overstressing the employment of lone mothers as a universal solution may thus lead to new dependencies.","lone mothers, poverty, work, divorce, gender, Czech Republic.",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,TRUE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.162434,5.6036344

Based on a qualitative analysis of interviews with parents of children under 12, we examine the processes that led to the increase or dismantling of the gender division of labour in families during the first nationwide lockdown. Using the concepts of path dependency and 'doing' and 'undoing' gender, we explain the strategies couples with children used to adapt to the enormous increase in reproductive work in the family during lockdown. 'Doing gender' practices witnessed during lockdown included an acceptance of the increased care work as the responsibility of women, ensuring 'a room of one's own' only for men, and separating the public and private sphere only for men. Practices that led to 'undoing gender' involved mainly the explicit negotiation between partners of the division of labour during the lockdown and the organisation of reproductive work in 'shifts'. The division of labour within a couple before the pandemic proved to be crucial for what strategy they chose to adapt to the lockdown. According to our findings, extending the egalitarian division of labour has led to greater satisfaction among partners and indicates greater societal resilience to crises.","pandemic, Covid-19, division of labour, doing gender, undoing gender",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0.10439321014050418,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05097709896837905,10.660272,5.3174562

The concept of social roles used here considers a plurality of role repertoires, which actors can choose from, combine, and variously emphasise. Focusing on the social roles of the sibling and the sibling-in-law shows how each of these roles is specific. Both of these roles have a repertoire of targeted support for sibling/ kin cohesiveness and a repertoire of common solidarity and sociability. The sibling's role also includes repertoires of intimate closeness and emergency assistance. Both roles can be performed as a minimalist repertoire. The repertoire of the sibling-in-law role is defined in relation to the role of the sibling/the life partner; the minimum expectation of a sibling is to not avoid contact with others and to show an interest in his/her sibling. Both roles are based on mutual autonomy and at the same time a willingness to maintain the sibling / kin relationship. How the two roles interfere and interact with each other is clear and provides insight into other dimensions of both roles. While it is possible to remain with the minimalist repertoire, it can generally be said that the role of a sibling and the role of a sibling-in-law acquire increasing importance as people grow older.","sibling, sibling-in-law, social role, role repertoire",czech,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.297678,3.607253

Drawing on data from the Life Course 2010 survey and theories that seek to explain low fertility, logistic regressions are used to test what factors are connected to intentions to remain childless and what factors relate to intentions to have just one child. Some factors were founded to be linked to both intentions to remain childless and intentions to have just one child: an older age, a lower level of education, changing reproductive intentions, not having a partner, and less emphasis on the need to be parent to be fulfilled in life. Other factors were found to relate only to intentions to remain childless. Intentions to remain childless and intentions to have one child can thus be regarded as reproductive intentions that are underpinned by similar but not identical factors.","reproductive intentions, childlessness, one-child families",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.40321,5.3526306

An assemblage is made up of heterogenic, rhizomatic, and often unpredictable connections, both organic and inorganic and linguistic and material, that continuously transform each other. An assemblage is never finished but is always complete, which gives rise to the question of the relationship between a whole and its parts, thus challenging the perception of disability as a lack and making it possible to think of disability in an affirmative sense. Disability can thus be analysed as a dynamic phenomenon that acquires its concrete contours in specific situations and to consider its discursive and material character. Thus, the concept of assemblage captures both the stability and the fluidity of disability and focuses on connections that maintain and decompose it. On the one hand, disability represents hegemonic discourses about health and the body, while on the other hand, it is a breeding ground for subversive processes.","disability, assemblage, Deleuze-Guattarian philosophy, dis/continuity, visual impairment",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.010077,3.6249616

The analysis combines an additive and multiplicative (intersectional) approach to research on unemployment in the Czech Republic. An additive model of binary logistic regression is accompanied by binary logistic regression models with interactions. The aim is to identify the factors and the social positions that result from the interaction of these factors that together influence chances of unemployment. The analysis shows that one source of inequality in interaction with other sources can have an entirely different impact on chances of unemployment than individual factors have on their own. An example is the interaction of gender and parenthood, which creates different social positions for different subpopulations. Motherhood, fatherhood, and the absence of the need to care for a young child can generate specific (dis)advantages for women or men also depending on the nature of their employment.","intersectionality, unemployment, inequalities, gender, logistic regression, interactions",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.26952097360980204,0,0,0.08130192784969868,0,0,0.07455560581641546,0,0,0,0,0.08155804256309056,10.9727955,7.0063415000000004

Whether and to what extent an individual is able to withstand failure depends on one's mental fitness, the degree of support received from one's social group, and historical and other circumstances. This article considers the proposition that the potential for disappointment largely hinges on what a person's motivation is to engage in environmentally-oriented behaviour. The author works with a typology of motivations derived from categories of normative ethics: teleological and deontological ethics and virtue ethics. The article first describes these motivational types on a general level and then examines them in relation to environmentalism. The findings of this study may have practical as well as theoretical significance: environmental problems cannot be tackled solely through technical and scientific efforts founded on goal-directed, teleological motivations, as these are at risk of succumbing to disappointment and fatigue. Environmental problems must be approached from a broad humanistic perspective, as it is on that level that the ethics of environmental virtue take shape and deontological motivations are reinforced - two approaches that are not grounded in great expectations and are thus relatively resistant to disappointment from negative environmental development and provide a basis for effective goal-directed behaviour.",": environmentally oriented motivations of individuals, teleology, deontology, virtue ethics, potential for disappointment",czech,Environment,environmental - change - movement - values - crisis - behaviour - pandemic - postsocialist - private - eastern,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5.6829014,4.9717083

The entry of fathers into a sphere our culture has traditionally defined as belonging to women necessarily raises one basic question - 'What does the experience of caring for their children mean in the minds of fathers?' - which contains an entire series of other more specific questions: How do these men interpret fatherhood? Is the experience of caring for their children reflected in how these men construct gender identities and what does this mean from the perspective of the production of gender and gender relations? Interviews based on a prepared scenario were conducted on a sample of twenty families in which the father had taken parental leave, and the resulting data was analysed with the aid of grounded theory in an effort to answer the questions outlined above. Of particular interest in the analysis are the interpretative frameworks that the actors employ in their perception of experienced reality and to what outcome or how much applies the constructivist perspective of making gender, which permits a focus on the similarities and differences between men and women and within those categories. The findings contribute to the understanding of the construction of fatherhood in this group of fathers, of gender and gender relations, and of how gender stereotypes operate on the micro level of Czech society.","gender difference, gender similarity, gender in/equality, caring fatherhood, Czech Republic.",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.241469,5.4684815

These narratives are re-constructed from 20 semi-structured interviews with the engaged actors and a corpus of 82 written documents, such as blogs, speeches, and declarations concerning the referendum. The analysis employs the methods of thick description and the structural analysis of narrative genres. It shows that, first, the referendum controversy presents a clash between a narrative of social decline and a narrative of social progress. The narratives serve as moral regulators by deploying emotionally loaded images of nostalgia for 'traditional families' and a utopia of unconditional progress. Second, although both narratives interpret the referendum as a milestone in the history of Slovakia, they do so in different genres with specific implications for action. Using the example of the decision by referendum opponents to withdraw from the pre-referendum debates, I demonstrate how narrative genres as implicit and deep cultural structures have the power to orient action and shape the contours of controversy.","narrative, genre, culture, meaning-making, referendum",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.11731103855031252,0,0,0.12157960315855684,0,0,0,0,6.709451,4.6610723

Many scholars think that social stratification of the electorate may lead to differential political representation of social groups thereby weakening the legitimacy of democracy among the lower social strata who participate least in politics. In this respect, it is often argued that one of the roles of schools is to reduce the difference in civic participation among students coming from families in different social strata. In this vein, this article examines if (a) type of classroom learning operationalised as 'open classroom climate' and (b) the socioeconomic composition of the class help to explain differences in students' level of civic knowledge and attitudes toward voting. The data used in this study comes from the International Citizenship and Civic Education (ICCS) survey of 8th-grade student carried out in 2009. The multilevel modelling results show that the SES of a students' family does help to explain differences in pupils' civic knowledge and attitudes toward voting, and this classroom effect is especially strong among low SES students. In contrast, the presence of an open classroom climate has no significant effects on knowledge or attitudes to voting. This article concludes with a discussion of how these findings shape current understanding of how contrasting educational trajectories may have political consequences over the long-term.","inequality, family background, civic knowledge, open classroom climate, voting turnout",czech,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,TRUE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.5014787,5.6590486

The article maps the possible causes and consequences of fear of crime in reference to the literature and the specific milieu of the Czech Republic. The author draws on a representative sample of 2836 respondents from the fifth wave of the European Social Survey. Consistent with findings in international research the data suggest that a perceived risk of victimisation is a significant factor influencing respondents' fear. Conversely, indicators of vulnerability, such as gender and satisfaction with family income or victimisation, although statistically significant, explain only a small part of the variability of the dependent variable. Rather they act vicariously right through the perceived risk of victimisation. Finally, the data suggest that fear of crime can play an important role in shaping attitudes towards different social institutions, in particular the police. A higher fear of crime correlates with/is associated with a worse assessment of police effectiveness.","fear of crime, perceived risk of victimisation, police effectiveness, European Social Survey Round 5",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06967064758074629,0,0,8.736596,4.3869085

One important area that criminal policy research has long dealt with is public attitudes to punishment. Statements that the public want more severe punishments for those who break the law are often used to justify introducing measures to make the criminal justice system harsher. There are, however, different ways to measure public opinion on criminal sentencing. While general attitudinal questions indicate the public to be very punitive in outlook, when they have to evaluate specific cases the results are slightly more positive. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey, the article aims to describe the current level of punitiveness in the Czech Republic, as measured by both above-mentioned indicators, and to assess whether the respondents' answers to such indicators are influenced by the same factors. Data show that Czechs tend to have relatively strong punitive attitudes. However, past studies have shown that people are less punitively inclined when they are judging a specific case. Moreover, regression analysis suggests that, rather than individual punitive sentiments, the general measure of punitiveness reflects cognitive and emotional reactions of a different nature (e.g. the quality of work of the court system), which means that the information on public attitudes it produces could be misleading.","public attitudes to punishment, new punitiveness, restorative justice, prison population, ESS R 5",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05851288888078455,0,0,8.707607,4.3790545

This has implications for their family relationships and educational careers in childhood, but beyond that it also has effects that are detectable into adulthood.

The interconnection between transnationalism and integration is widely discussed in both sociological and anthropological literature, and most scholars identify them as synergetic processes. In the case of Ukrainian students in the Czech Republic, however, the authors argue that these processes can be understood as both synergetic and antagonistic because what matters is the students' self-identification. Most of the analysis presented in this article is based on in-depth interviews with Ukrainian students conducted between 2012 and 2019. The results of qualitative research are also compared to and discussed in relation to the findings from an on-line survey conducted among 258 Ukrainian students in 2018.

There is a hidden racism that exists in the attitudes of the majority population to Vietnamese immigrants. However, the paper also documents instances of convivial everyday interactions.

This article examines the link between transnationalism and integration processes among return migrants from the Armenian diaspora and examines the role social networks play in integration in Armenia. Returnees to Armenia can be divided into those who have returned from the Armenian diaspora (second and subsequent generations of migrants) and those who emigrated from Armenia and decided to return. This is reflected in the literature as a distinction between the 'old' and the 'new' Armenian diaspora, the latter having emerged in the 1990s. Before returning, both groups maintained ties with people in Armenia and may differ only by the extent and frequency of use of these ties. These ties can then accompany them when they return to Armenia and help them to (re-)integrate. The integration of returnees has its own specifics, compared to the integration of migrants, and may not be as simple as it might seem. This article focuses on the transnational ties of 23 migrants of Armenian descent who returned to Armenia after a long time abroad and draws on original research on return migration in Armenia conducted in 2016 and 2018. Semi-structured interviews with returnees revealed that their participation in the labour market is instrumental to their integration into mainstream society, and their work may involve transnational activities. The article shows the different opportunities that weak and strong ties provide returnees and that may facilitate their integration. Weak ties on a local level are crucial for returnees to be able to reintegrate and fully participate in life in Armenia. The article aims to understand the return strategy as one of the migration options that may or may not be permanent. A return may be followed by re-migration, under certain conditions and if obstacles to sustainable reintegration, and the article also explores the motivations for re-migration.","return migration, transnationalism, diaspora, reintegration, Armenia",czech,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.6998205,3.0776994

Based on ethnographic observations in two facilities and interviews with teachers and parents, we explore relationships between peers, social routines, and the creation of collectivity. We focus on the perspective of adults and their perception of the children's collective and on the meanings of children's interactions. The analyses reveal that as well as socialising in hierarchical relationships with adults they also actively participate in cultural reproduction through the interpretation of meanings. What constitutes 'play' when socialising with adults becomes 'something real' when it occurs between physical and cognitive equals. Interaction with peers in a day-care facility allows a child to experience a collective 'WE', through which they are then able to to control adults.

When analysing the era of privatisation, recent research on public policy has concluded that public authorities' ability to influence or shape national energy choices has been substantially weakened. Since the mid-2000s, however, tight cooperation between private investors and UK public regulators and policy-makers has emerged as a critical factor to meet the challenges posed by the energy transition. How have the British public authorities tried to get private actors on board and to involve them not only in the delivery and funding of energy services, as has been the case with public-private partnerships, but also in the decision-making process?

This analysis explores the various strategies used to facilitate 'decompartmentalising' initiatives and ensure a smooth transition towards a neo-corporatist revival of the Triple Helix involving industry, academia, and government. It shows how these hybrid processes offer valuable insight for analysing and reconceptualising the boundary between the public and the private sectors.

A key issue is found to be the timing of the grandparenting role, when a period of intensive care may be followed by a performative void. From the perspective of gender structure, however, these are asynchronous changes, which makes it possible for a couple to perform their roles in a complementary manner. As some young olds pursue self-development activities indicative of active ageing with and through their grandchildren, alongside the possible duality of active ageing (as a semi-public, socially productive effort) versus grandparenting, it is possible to speak of active ageing through grandparenting, and of grandparenting as a form of active ageing.","grandparenting, social role, active ageing, role overload, performative void",czech,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.253534,3.5695648

Analysing parliamentary debates from this period, we show that the delegitimised social system is no longer understood as a tool of social protection or even labour market inclusion; rather, it has become a tool of ethnic hierarchisation, which particularly resonates in the context of perceived socioeconomic insecurity. We propose the term ‘post-neoliberal ethnic welfare’ to describe this emerging system, which derives its legitimacy from neoliberal categories of deservingness and reduces social-protection systems into a performative tool of control over the Roma population.","welfare, Roma, neoliberalism, race, socially excluded localities",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.10845974092148974,0.14685538492861977,0,0.05173179780741917,0.06529828189646936,0.08270629992642274,0,0,5.696103,3.6933248

This article examines this vague concept to shed light on how its evolution over time has shaped the current conceptions of migrant integration in the EU and the Czech Republic. It describes the situation in the Czech Republic and the country's normative goals in the field of migrant integration. While the country has explicit integration priorities in place, there is no evaluation of their fulfilment. The article explores whether these priorities are indeed fulfilled and from what sources by analysing a unique dataset of 3061 projects in the field of migrant integration. All these projects were implemented in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2019. The results show that although funding for migrant integration has increased since 2016, even taking into account the long-term increase in the number of migrants in the Czech Republic, funding in support of these priorities is allocated very unevenly. European funding remains crucial. Among the most supported priorities is knowledge of the Czech language and education. There is also some support in the social field. By contrast, the issues of discrimination, equal rights, foreign nationals' access to health care, and the development of professional skills receive hardly any support. The results thus show a discrepancy between the priorities that have been set and their fulfilment, especially in the area of activities targeting the majority society and its institutions. The declared two-sidedness to the process of integration process thus remains a somewhat unsupported vision.","integration, migration, governance, transnationalism, evaluation",czech,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.823668,3.206312

This article focuses on the gender inequalities that are reflected in the construction of men’s and women’s roles and responsibilities in copreneurships (romantic couples in business together) and how those constructions are embedded in societal and the family context. By drawing on qualitative in-depth interviews with copreneurs in Czechia and Slovakia and interviewing each partner separately we are able to analyse how roles are constructed and the justifications given for them as well as identifying how the partners’ constructions of these roles clash. We show how gender inequalities are created and presented as logical and self-evident. By studying copreneurial couples we can examine both their professional and private lives and reveal reveal whether they interact in conflicting or complementary ways. The main contribution of the research is that it provides insight into the seemingly gender-neutral constructions of copreneurial roles, and it employs a methodological approach that has the capacity to identify differences and similarities in copreneurs’ viewpoints. The article highlights the ways in which copreneur constructions reflect the unique contexts of Czechia and Slovakia, a region that to now has been largely unexplored.","copreneurship, gender, context, post-socialism, entrepreneurship",czech,Partnership,marriage - partnership - family - gender - division - transitions - partners - status - families - sociodemographic,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0.11496460610487497,0,0,0.22540176466942277,0,0,0,0,0,11.368919,6.1883006

We estimated the size of the wealth gap between each immigrant population and natives, the sources of the gap, and the trajectory of wealth convergence. The data revealed that the mean net worth of native-born groups was higher than that of all immigrant sub-groups. The gap was widest for non-European immigrants and lowest for West, Central, and South European immigrants. Differences in the rate of homeownership accounted for the largest portion of the gap, while neither differential levels of income nor education accounted for much of the gap between native-born and either non-European immigrants or immigrants from post-communist countries. Reception of gifts or inheritances did not account for a meaningful portion of the gaps. Estimation of the rate of convergence suggests that it would take an average of 85 years after arrival for an average immigrant household to bridge the wealth gap between it and an average native-born household.

A multinomial logistic model with a random intercept was applied, in which students' aspirations for pursuing higher education served as the outcome variable. Apart from indicators of socio-economic status (SES), vocational school students' characteristics related to cultural habits and behaviours, as well as their concerns with downward mobility, were used as regressor variables in the analysis. All three constructs showed independent effects on aspirations for higher education, controlling for vocational sector, gender, school achievement, and school year. Further, a moderation effect was identified, indicating that the association between cultural capital and aspirations for higher education was stronger among students with more educated parents. In contrast to previous studies, the findings point to the potential complementarity of cultural capital and RRA concerning educational aspirations.

The findings show that (i) with one exception, in all the countries and years, mothers whose preferences were congruent with their actual employment statuses outnumbered those whose preferences and employment statuses were incongruent; (ii) whereas Czech mothers improved their situations during the period (the congruity increases), Polish mothers - who began the period with the highest congruity - experienced a decrease in congruity, while Hungarian mothers showed the lowest congruity and saw a slight improvement in their situations (they achieved more congruity); and (iii) women who had their children during the communist regimes were more likely to experience incongruity because they worked more than they desired to, while women who became mothers during the post-communist period were more likely to experience congruity when they stayed at home, but they were also more likely to experience incongruity because they were inactive and considered working desirable. Therefore, the results confirm similar trends and diverging paths among the three countries. The high degree of incongruity between preferences and actual experiences is a sign of the problems faced by mothers attempting to reconcile work and family life and also impacts other phenomena, such as female employment, gender equality and fertility.","work-family conflict, gender roles, refamilialisation, fertility, post-communism",english,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.096415,5.8136125

He shows how local identification and position in the residential structure of the village studied here translated into a more enduring differentiation among Roma themselves. The author argues that crucial to understanding this process is the racialised category of 'Gypsyness', through which the Roma were singled out as 'less local'. 'Gypsyness' was also strongly associated with the space of the settlement and at the same time served as a generally accepted reason for its very existence. By setting up their own strategy of social mobility and striving to achieve full-fledged local belonging, the Roma, to a large extent, subscribed to the dominant logic of 'Gypsyness' and thus reproduced it, but they also transformed some of its characteristics, integrating it into their own understanding of their sociability in an environment of historically rooted non-Romani dominance.","Roma, eastern Slovakia, Gypsyness, local belonging, territorialisation, territorial stigmatisation, Romani settlements",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.1622744977261314,0.07438803805141929,0,0.06474572080785629,0.0651309752355529,0.06131924431727924,0,0,6.986983,3.5961351

To capture this process, the concept of 'assemblage' is introduced and then defined as a temporary constellation of a variety of different actors, both public and private. Building on research interviews and documents produced in the RHW field, the authors then proceed in three steps. First, they chronologically trace the gradual emergence of the Czech RHW assemblage from a variety of different actors-bureaucrats, NGOs, academics, journalists-after Russia's attack on Ukraine in 2014. Second, they unpack the inner workings of the assemblage by identifying the key actors and asking who did the assembling and how. Third, they look at how different actors were able to reinforce and/or transform their identities by being part of the assemblage, with an emphasis on the effects this had for the distinction between the public and the private.","hybrid warfare, disinformation, assemblage, Russia, Czech Republic",english,Environment,environmental - change - movement - values - crisis - behaviour - pandemic - postsocialist - private - eastern,FALSE,0.14118717037787196,0,0.05503283390421669,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14186641350448204,0,6.410647,5.27243

It is argued that postmodern declarations of the end of ideological battles, together with the critiques of universalising concepts related to science, knowledge, and education, have been recaptured in 'new' vocabularies promoted by neoliberal approaches. While postmodernism dismissed many of the meanings previously attached to knowledge and education, it also opened up space to expand on them in terms of their exchange value. The essay shows how neoliberal approaches attacked this space and developed a systematic conception that links knowledge and education to the rationality of the market. The 'new' vocabulary clearly expresses universalising claims, as this is evident in the usage of such concepts as the knowledge revolution, the knowledge economy, public relevance, social impact, or excellence. This essay concludes with a discussion of how these tendencies are affecting sociology and its disciplinary identity in terms of both its educational and its research activities. In general, it is claimed that the regressive effects of the neoliberal regime of knowledge on sociology cannot be avoided, as the overall academic, institutional, and material context now being constructed by the 'new' knowledge ideology does not overlap with the intellectual claims on which sociology was founded.

First, the authors aim to analyse the factors that affect the intention of Czech consumers to purchase organic food using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Second, they employ an extended TPB model that introduces descriptive norms as an additional actor of behavioural intention. This study exploits data from a consumer survey of a sample of the Czech general adult population (N = 252) conducted in 2010. Structural equation modelling with an ML estimator is used to estimate model parameters. The empirical model derived from the TPB explains 44% of the variability of intention to purchase organic food. Descriptive norms are empirically distinct from injunctive norms and their inclusion in the model increases the explained variance of intention by an additional 5 percentage points. Attitudes and norms are the strongest predictors of the intention to purchase organic food, while perceived behavioural control has only a weak effect.","theory of planned behaviour, organic food consumption, structural equation modelling, descriptive norms, Czech Republic",english,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8.014453,4.77066

Poor accessibility to micro-regional cores by public transport was used as the criterion to define municipalities as peripheral. Peripheral areas. Seven state-border, six county-border and nine intra-county peripheral areas were delimited in the South Bohemian region. Consequently, the authors monitored the differences between peripheral areas and their types and between peripheral municipalities, semi-peripheral municipalities, suburban municipalities and micro-regional cores (towns) on the basis of dissimilar values of defined indicators of social-population instability. Such differences are also explained in terms of the concept of spatially conditioned social exclusion. The authors defined and used some basic socio-economic indicators in their research: index of population development between 1971 and 2009 and between 1990 and 2009; proportion of the population in the age groups 0-14 and 65+ in 2009; rate of registered unemployment in 2009; proportion of the population with the secondary school-leaving examination in 2001; number of flats built per 1000 inhabitants between 2000 and 2008. Social-population instability was found mainly in county-border peripheral areas and also in a number of state-border peripheral areas. The authors also examined regional social policies for peripheral municipalities and peripheral areas. In the article's theoretical discussion, and to explain regional social policies for peripheral municipalities and areas, the authors draw on the concept of social exclusion and distinguish spatially unconditioned social exclusion and spatially conditioned social exclusion, which includes social exclusion that results from living in peripheral municipalities and areas.","peripheral areas, social stability, population stability, social indicators, social exclusion, rural development, Czech Republic.",czech,Rural,spatial - areas - rural - differentiation - patterns - demographic - social exclusion - cities - population - socioeconomic,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6.505548,2.011677

His battle against the idea of a politically and morally neutral understanding of social inquiry was rhetorically compelling and anticipated the radical voices that would be heard in the late 1960s. It is argued in this article that probably the best lesson we can get from Mills has to do with his understanding of 'sociology as a profession'. His argument addresses crucially important questions about the public relevance of social inquiry and the underlying themes of social-scientific reflexivity, creativity, and non-conformity. However, despite his rhetorical force and stylistic brilliance, Mills' overall message is considered ambivalent. His concept of social inquiry based on identification of morally and politically relevant problems ultimately leads to the vaporisation of the very substance of social inquiry and to the institutional debilitation of the field as such. The resulting uncertainty concerning the basic means and ends of sociology, together with a hyper-tolerance towards the delineation of sociological research area, often leads to the identifi cation of relevant problems on the basis of individual choice, inspiration, creativity, or imagination. It is suggested that this understanding of Mills' legacy usually results in the trivialisation and parody of the overall message embodied in The Sociological Imagination.","imagination, creativity, identification of problems, value-neutrality, morally committed social inquiry.",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.23595979454432703,0,0,0,0,0,0.06698322631368768,0,0,0,0,7.470625,6.105628

We find that notwithstanding some divisiveness, there exists considerable convergence along the three dimensions of legitimacy: input, output and throughput. Indeed, both camps challenge EU legitimacy, but they do so for different reasons and focus on different dimensions. The output aspect of EU legitimacy is the most problematic and criticised within both types of discourse. The input dimension is problematic only within the 'anti-immigrant' discourse, and the throughput dimension of EU legitimacy is rather neglected within both discourses.

Considering that these emerging forms of housing in the Czech Republic have yet to be conceptualised in theory, the goal of our article is to initiate a debate on a more precise conceptual understanding.

The data corpus includes qualitative interviews with selected actors in the prison world and an analysis of relevant documents relating to the research topic. Sociology and the prison system meet on two basic levels in the Czech Republic. As an external partnership that seems to have grown stronger over the years and as an internal bond that has weakened (and almost been dismissed) since the end of the 1990s.  Sociology has formally retained a place behind the bars of Czech prisons thanks to the sociologists who according to the regulations of the Czech prison service should figure among the prison staff. In reality, the initial enthusiasm for this practice faded over the years and there are no sociologists currently working in Czech prisons.

These mechanisms and practices must be employed in order to resolve a fundamental tension between the demand for self-disclosure, arising out of confessional culture and the ideology of authenticity, and the parallel demand for retaining privacy. Breach of privacy is conceptualised as a violation of the equilibrium of its three constitutive elements: content, border, and context. Such situations are experienced as threats to the identity of the youtubers, who seek to avoid these threats by means of reparation practices, changes in how they perform privacy, and the use of what we call tools of controlled (in)accessibility.

Many scholars draw on Inglehart's concept of post-materialism and consider voluntary simplicity to be a way of limiting one's consumption in order to free oneself and seek satisfaction in the non-material aspects of life. These scholars assume that the values associated with simplicity emerge out of over-saturation with consumption. This article discusses the results of research conducted among Czech households who voluntarily reduce consumption and who do so in a post-socialist context, without having first lived in affluence. Theoretically and methodologically, the article builds on the work of Hana Librová [1994, 2003; Librová et al. 2016] and is rooted in three main concepts: the concepts of post-materialism [Inglehart 1977], 'new luxury' [Enzensberger 1996], and the normative ethical theories of motivation [Pelikán and Librová 2015]. The findings of the study call into question Inglehart's structural assumption that non-consumption lifestyles like voluntary simplicity only develop in affluent societies and suggest that the Czech socialist past created conditions suitable for the emergence of a non-ideological and primarily self-oriented version of voluntary simplicity. The roots of simple lifestyles may also lie in people's dissatisfaction with the promise of modernity, a promise suggesting that it is possible to attain and lead the good life through material abundance. Prior experience with an affluent lifestyle did not play a role in the decision of participants in this study to live a nonconsumption lifestyle. This study in a post-socialist country therefore has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the motivations for choosing voluntary simplicity.","voluntary simplicity, non-consumption lifestyles, theory of postmaterialism, motivations for simplicity, post-socialism",english,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7.712712,4.6489873

Consistent with previous studies, the analyses reveal, that most of the competitive relationships (which were primarily defensive in nature) observed in this study occurred in the socioeconomic dimension, but they also show that there is very strong potential for intense party competition to develop in the other two dimensions if they become more salient.","party competition, policy space, elections",czech,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.183414,6.4717774

The rich contemporary theoretical discussion on niche parties has noted that they focus more on defending their programme than exercising political power. This assumption, however, has not been tested on empirical data on the real activity of niche parties in the political arena.

The article explores the acceptance of divorce in three aspects: 1) it measures and compares the trends in the acceptance of divorce in various European societies between 1981(1991) and 2017 and contrasts these trends with the data on divorce rates in these countries; (2) it explores the consistency/correlation between divorce attitudes and the affinitive value orientations associated in the broader set of values connected with the concept of the deinstitutionalisation of marriage; (3) it looks for the correlates of divorce acceptance and the changes in acceptance over time at the individual level (sex, education, cohort, family background, religiosity). Because of the descriptive nature of the research, no hypotheses are tested. The results show that divorce acceptance is rising over time in all EVS countries, and the acceptance is connected to divorce levels in given societies. Attitudes towards divorce form a consistent set of values together with other marriage deinstitutionalisation indicators. The acceptance of divorce correlates on an individual level with age, education, and religion, but surprisingly there is only weak difference between men and women.","divorce, divorce acceptance, attitudes towards divorce, European Values Study, social norms",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.07600053670447177,0,0,0.08852054769994061,0,0,0.07019278730101616,0,0,0,0,0.11246819859657964,11.028455,6.9027143

We use data from the first large-scale sociological survey focusing on physical attractiveness carried out in Europe and in particular from the follow-up to the Czech national survey of adult competencies (PIAAC). First, using structural modelling to identify differences in how men and women transform family background, formal education, competencies, socio-economic status of occupation and physical attractiveness into income, we found strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that, in general, physically more attractive people have better chance of obtaining a higher socio-economic status occupations, and higher incomes than less attractive people, but the causalities are different for men and women. Second, replicating the linear regression models applied to North American data we assessed the differences in returns to beauty between Czech men and women and found that, unlike in North America, in the Czech Republic the income premium for beauty is markedly higher among women than men, while men capitalise on their attractiveness more in the area of occupational status. We conclude that while returns to beauty are culturally universal, gender differences in these returns are culturally specific.","attractiveness, human capital, skills, education, labour market outcomes, gender gaps, structural modelling",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.13279953172092074,0,0,0.06683154092518265,0,0,0.08404711636331277,0,0,0,0,0.07050989828266063,10.7811165,7.317184

This approach can be useful for explaining the gender structure of the causes and consequences of divorce. Here more attention is given to studies that explicitly mention the concept of gender at the structural, institutional, and interactional levels. It reviews the literature on gender as part of the institutional environment, and in this context it introduces the perspectives on changing gender roles as a factor influencing divorce and the literature mapping the potential of divorce to change the gender order of society.

This intention was tied to the needs of a society of mass production and was based on the standardisation and normalisation not only of production and industry facilities, but also of settlements and dwellings and even of the individual activities of people and their lives as a whole. In this society, the concentration of workers in larger factories and their subordination to precise division of labour entailed the imposition of disciplinary power over their bodies and the indoctrination of their minds with corporate ideology. All this, along with the surveillance and control of the people's lives, not just at work in the production plant but also in their homes, their schools, during their leisure time activities, and even through the overall urban layout itself, combined to give the town's inhabitants a specific collective identity.

It works with ethnographic data and puts forth the idea that unlike dominant places, which are strategically produced and can be ascribed one dominant meaning and associated practice, in the case of tactically produced places there are always multiple meanings and thus a myriad of associated practices. These specific places are 'heterotopias'. The article describes the (re)production of one heterotopia and in doing so offers an empirically based conceptualisation of such a place.","homelessness, the poorest class, space-time, everyday practices, time-space mobility, heterotopias, urban revitalisation, spatial hierarchy",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.7071514,3.4297793

Based on previous analyses and published work, the article formulates the hypothesis that the process of crystallisation of the two main ideologies or norms of distributive justice, namely meritocratic and egalitarian ideologies, which was confirmed in analyses carried out from 1991 to 1995, continued in later years. The article draws on the fundamental theories of distributive justice and utilises data from surveys carried out in 1991, 1995, 2006 and 2009, which the authors analyse in terms of measurement and structural models. The models confirm the hypothesis that the crystallisation of norms of distributive justice continued in more recent years, and that at present these norms are internally structured in almost the same way as in advanced democracies. These norms are thus closely tied to the stratification system, which means that meritocracy has solidified its position as the dominant norm of distributive justice, whereas egalitarianism has gradually become a 'challenging' norm preferred by individuals in lower-status positions in the stratification system.","distributive justice, legitimacy of inequality, meritocracy, redistribution, stratification, social transformation.",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.2340709481831524,0,0,0.05515793409694065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07576953281055278,4.6329045,4.6569986

This article summarises the discussions concerning the countermovement phenomenon in the last thirty years. The starting point of the interest in countermovements of different kinds in the Western context is generally considered to lie in the 1970s and the 1980s, when the opposition to the reform movements of the preceding period became more intense. In an attempt to define this phenomenon, sociology made use of its theoretical and methodological apparatus available at that time. Therefore, resource mobilization theory, the political opportunities/ political process model, and framing theory gradually looked at countermovements from different points of view and concentrated on different parts of their life cycle. This article first discusses various countermovement definitions and dilemmas which sociologists have faced in their analysis. It then focuses on the key dimensions of the countermovement life cycle: its genesis and mobilization, strategy and tactics, and its potential effects. Emphasis is placed on the comparison of different theoretical and methodological approaches and the dynamic movement-countermovement relationship. The topics are illustrated on examples from relevant case studies. The conclusion summarises the areas to which the social sciences, in analysing the problems of countermovements, pay very little attention.","social movements, countermovements, conservative movements, countermovement mobilization, countermovement strategies, countermovement effects, political opportunity structure, resource mobilization, framing.",czech,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,0.1357225267766149,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09618802145822854,0,5.5499544,5.452787

The battery of survey questions used identified six dimensions of the value of children (The positives of parenthood; Natural drives and goals; Tradition and social status; Social pressure; Limitations and losses; and Decision inhibitors). The respondents, young people between the ages of 28 and 34, see the main reasons for deciding to have children in the positive feelings associated with raising children and with successful parenthood as a natural part of life. They associate parenthood less with responses about social norms and pressure or with rational considerations about all the pros and cons of having children, and they see parenthood as their own, individual decision.

An analysis of the interactions between the candidates and the committee members, based on publicly available audiovisual recordings, shows that the candidates differed in their perceptions of their agency and its limits, but it was the public and dialogical arrangement of the hearings that shaped the conditions for the emergence of the specific image of ethical-political agency. This study thus grasps the public hearing as a form of institutional work that disrupts the notion that the relationship between the individual and the structure is invariable.

The district’s proximity to a landfill and the consequent environmental effects of this played a decisive role in its ghettoisation, yet these factors have never been systematically analysed and discussed.

Utilising the conceptual and theoretical framework of environmental justice, the article focuses on the spatial distribution of the adverse environmental effects in relation to social and ethnic factors. The case of Luník IX, with its roots in the period of a centrally planned economy, provides a unique opportunity to make a comparative study of the social processes from a historical perspective. It allows us to analyse the mechanism of decision-making in an avowedly non-capitalist society, where in reality we see many similarities in how income inequality between richer and poorer neighbourhoods, together with ethnic/racial factors, has shaped the city.","environmental justice, Roma ethnic minority, Luník IX, urban ghetto",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.14599777273839473,0.06282334323400737,0,0.05211262694357507,0.05373277543150714,0,0,0,7.0204353,3.4801981

The study understands ageing as an embodied process and explores the meanings that are attached to the body in the narratives of older persons who have acquired impairment in later life and are receiving care. Because the onset of impairment and infirmity marks a point of transition, the study considers the bodily aspects of the ageing process as key elements, despite this being highly problematic in current social gerontology. The authors call for a complex approach to understanding the meanings of the body in the transitions into old age and drawing on their own study based on three repeated interviews with ten older adults conducted over the course of one year (8 women, mean age = 83.8 years), they explore the meanings that are attached to the body in the context of receiving care. Their analysis of the personal accounts and narratives of everyday activities from the participants in their study revealed that embodiment in action is the main topic through which participants experienced their everydayness. The meanings of embodiment in action are shaped and reconstructed on three dimensions that capture important processes of embodiment in action: the sensing of the body (the Body as an Organiser of Activities), anticipation of the body (the Body as an Uncertain Companion), and the managing of the body (the Body as Work to Be Done). The findings offer insights into the processes of transitions in old age, in which the emotional, social, and behavioural aspects of embodiment in action, rather than age, play the key role. The study further highlights that the meanings of the body are complex, highly relevant, and should not be overlooked within the organisational practice of social and health care.","fourth age, body, transitions, acquired impairment, repeated interviews, meaning of the body",english,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,TRUE,0,0,0,0.8475095322849092,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.060828,3.3025682

The aim of this study is to test the instrument's measurement invariance between 2009 and 2019 and determine whether - despite the modifications made to the instrument over the years - the results remain comparable. Data from eight representative surveys of the economically active population in the Czech Republic were analysed (total N = 6909) using the MG CFA method (configural, metric, and scalar invariance) and the alignment method (approximate measurement invariance). The findings from the MG CFA tests for measurement invariance indicate that the SQWLi instrument achieves configural and metric invariance over time but not full scalar invariance. Achieving a partial scalar invariance would be challenging because of the many high modification indices; therefore, an approximate measurement invariance approach, namely the Alignment Method, was applied. The results suggest that comparisons of latent means across all years can be made. Consequently, it is possible to make meaningful comparisons of overall indices of dimensions (batteries) and of more general domains. However, not all the individual items can be compared. The results confirm that the biggest risk of invariance is caused by conceptual changes to items and by substantial or frequent modifications to item wording. Conversely, the results also show that a conceptual change to an entire dimension may not necessarily cause any problem on the general level, and that a disruption of invariance caused by changes to the range of scales used can be rectified by means of their harmonisation ex post.","SQWLi, subjective quality of working life, exact and approximate measurement invariance, alignment method",english,Methodology,quality - satisfaction - version - surveys - survey - value - effects - test - questionnaire - force,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,9.963671,6.486223

This article addresses this ‘satisfaction paradox’ by exploring the perceived work conditions of Czech academics based on their own reports. The data for this study included academics’ (N = 1202) qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding the main problems and benefits of their current academic work and workplace. Content analysis was used to categorise the respondents’ answers. Academics reported heavy workloads (26.5% of participants), a lack of financial resources (26.3%), poorquality leadership (23.7%), excessive administration (16.3%), and job insecurity (10.9%) as the most problematic aspects of their workplaces. In contrast, academics reported that good social relationships in the workplace (46.3%), autonomy of academic work (41.8%), personal fulfilment (28.9%), and work/contact with students (25.3%) were the aspects of their workplaces they valued most. These positive features appear to be prevalent, as most (80%) academics reported overall satisfaction with their work. The authors draw on job demands–resources theory to suggest that the relatively high level of satisfaction is due to (still) high levels of key job resources that support the intrinsic motivation of academics despite an environment that can be considered suboptimal in some aspects. They also point to inequalities in job demands and job resources between subgroups of academics and highlight key systemic issues that should be addressed to improve the work conditions at Czech public higher education institutions.","quality of work life, academic staff, job satisfaction, higher education, public universities, job demands, job resources",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.07688438075621104,0,0,0.07177806259294471,0,0,0.05911725812025813,0,0,0,0,0.0875789475003659,9.331622,6.049558

BC emphasise the hybrid character of their identity, i.e. the necessity of using two languages and behaving in accordance with the norms of two ethnic societies in their everyday lives. YUV declare that competence in Czech and knowledge of the social norms of the majority cannot change the fact that they are Vietnamese. YG assign basically the same features to their own category as to BC. But unlike them, YG usually consider the hybrid character of their identity to be self-evident. That the analysed texts problematise the role of language as a defining feature of ethnic identity can be considered an expression of the superdiversification of the Czech media and new media space.

One of the issues on which public opinion differs greatly in different regions is the perception of migrants and migration in general. The aim of this paper is therefore to evaluate the extent to which this perception indeed differs across regions, and what factors can explain the variation. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was fielded among secondary-school students in three Czech cities, which proved the existence of significant regional differences in attitudes towards migration. However, these differences greatly depend on how the attitudes are measured - by far the most pronounced differences are found in the attitudes towards the refugees and immigrant groups associated with the recent wave of refugees, attitudes towards whom were three times more negative among students in the Zlín region than among students in Prague. These differences can only partly be explained by the different characteristics of the regions and students. By contrast, friendly contact with foreign nationals seems to be the most vital explanatory variable. The article also presents a model that illustrates the possible process by which individual factors may shape students' attitudes towards migration.","Czech Republic, migration attitudes, spatial differentiation, upper secondary education",czech,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.9063187,3.3192687

Similarly, economic research which views the household as a single unit has been questioned. Changing family circumstances and the increased share of couples in which the woman has higher earnings, education, and socioeconomic status mean that both these perspectives needs reformulating. The authors illustrate these issues using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) for five Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria) and draw on its 2006–2016 time series to present the characteristics of partners in couples and the relations between them. Female primacy has increased either in earnings, education, or socio-economic category in all countries except Hungary. The authors use the EU-SILC 2010 ‘Module on Intra-household Sharing of Resources’ to test the hypothesis that a direct link exists between partners’ social status split and separate welfare status, where female primacy in relevant characteristics is taken as a proxy for social status split, while separate welfare status is indicated by partners’ budgetary discretion. The hypothesis is confirmed for Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, but not for Hungary and Poland. Apart from the personal factors of social status split, two family factors are strongly related to the probability of the budgetary discretion of couple partners across all countries: household income and marital status.","social stratification, couples, status split, budgetary discretion, Central Europe",english,Partnership,marriage - partnership - family - gender - division - transitions - partners - status - families - sociodemographic,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.8312071097052233,0,0,0,0,0,11.344665000000001,6.6292415

Within the scope of the first two goals, the author shows that welfare surveillance is theoretically construed along the lines of a specific combination of social justice and neoliberal governmentality, and that welfare surveillance enables the application of specific illiberal practices to welfare applicants and recipients in order to effectively discipline and normalise them, which results in the stigmatisation and criminalisation of recipients.

It describes the basic (micro-, mezzo-, and macro-) levels on which quality of working life can be measured and discusses the problem of the duality of social phenomena consisting in objective conditions and actors' subjective perception of them. Based on this concept, it identifies what the SQWLI is intended to capture, specifically, the micro-level aspect of how workers themselves subjectively perceive the quality of working life.

The other view argues that the movement is undergoing profound changes but its major principles and identity - at least latently - have survived. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it strives to re-introduce the concepts of 'spillover' and 'spillout' as multidimensional social processes and operationalise them to apply to the evolution of the Czech GJM in 2003-2009. Second, the article empirically traces the thematic shift of the Czech GJM towards anti-war activism and demonstrates that it is the movement's collective identity that constitutes a key obstacle to its spillout in an unfavourable environment.","contentious politics, collective identity, social movement spillover, global justice movement, anti-war activism, Czech Republic",english,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,0.12692855991126897,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09594883735459066,0,5.66161,5.474962

This article studies whether and why care by grandmothers and grandfathers is influenced by their family arrangement. Following previous research, the authors focus on the mediating role of grandmothers in the involvement of men in caring for their grandchildren. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data about grandparents with small grandchildren (under ten years of age). The quantitative analysis is based on SHARE data and identifies whether the involvement in care depends on gender and the partnership arrangements of grandparents, controlling for a number of other characteristics of families. The analysis reveals a strong positive impact of the presence of a partner on the engagement of men (but not women) in grandparental care. This effect is present among both intact families and families with more complex arrangements. The qualitative analysis of 20 interviews with mothers and 20 interviews with grandmothers provides a deeper understanding of these results. It shows that the involvement of grandparents is shaped by the gender-specific notions of care competence and grandparental roles held by the participants and also by the kin-keeping activities of women. Grandmothers, compared to their male counterparts, are perceived as more capable of satisfying the needs of a small child. They also do more work on maintaining intergenerational family relationships and arranging care.

The author identifies three strong norms of grandmothering: the norm of non-interference, the norm of constant availability, and the norm of activity. The narratives of both the mothers and the grandmothers reflected a strong 'gendered contact' between the two generations, which is based on a generational transfer of caring responsibilities. A new norm, the norm of activity, is mainly constructed by mothers and it involves the idea that a 'good' grandmother provides not just instrumental care but above all 'adventures'. Both the mothers and the grandmothers pointed out how the family role of grandmothers had changed compared to past generations of grandmothers. The article analyses the (changing) norms of grandmothering in relation to the changing cultural representation of ageing and especially in relation to ideas about active ageing, and it highlights some of the contradictory expectations that are attached to the role of grandmothers as a result of the inconsistent/clashing demands being made of them.","care, family, grandmothers, grandparents, intergenerational solidarity",czech,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.456688,3.8138406

Gerontosociology notes the elderly's preferential focus on the family, which is usually defined in terms of intergenerational relationships and a support network in old age. Relationships with siblings lie outside the research interest of gerontosociology because they are considered peer relationships, which is to say that they, too, are subject to the effects of ageing and old age and, consequently, are less reliable as a source of help or care. However, the article shows that the elderly assign meaning to their relationships with their siblings, which go beyond mere instrumental assistance and which challenges the generally accepted view that sibling bonds are of secondary importance compared to relationships between older parents and adult children. The article answers the question of what the essence of siblinghood in old age is, its possible forms, and in what ways (according to what rules) the elderly maintain or develop sibling relationships - how they communicate in interactions with each other and in interactions with other members of their family of procreation and their shared family of origin.

She analyses data from a qualitative empirical study in order to understand how various aspects of poverty in old age and the status of being poor impact seniors' performance of social roles. The author approaches poverty and old age as stigmas and looks at the ways in which seniors living in poverty defend their identity against inferior status. The article explains how the role of a poor senior is performed, whether and how poverty affects the roles that poor seniors share with other seniors, and whether the ascriptive status of old age or the objectively low social status of poverty is more significant for the performance of their role. Drawing on the results of her analysis the author describes poverty as the 'master status': poverty is an undesirable status for seniors and strategies for defending their identity against the stigma of poverty pushes the strategies of defence against the stigma of old age into the background.

We first check whether the value shift is moving in the assumed direction and whether it is copying trends observed in Western European countries. We then look at different generations to determine whether the younger generations in CEE countries that grew up after 1989, in a time of rapid economic and political change, show higher levels of post-materialist and post-modern values than the generations socialised and raised during the communist regime. We use data collected by the international repeated cross-sectional European Values Study (EVS). The results are not clear-cut on whether socioeconomic modernisation has led to higher shares of post-materialism, more gender-egalitarian attitudes, and stronger support for individual-choice norms in CEE countries. In all the spheres of cultural modernisation analysed we found differences in values and attitudes between generations: the older generations were always more traditional than the younger generations.

Higher-educated Europeans were both more post-materialistic and less materialistic in their work orientations than their lower-educated counterparts. This association was, however, weakened by tertiary expansion. Work-related post-materialism declined with the increasing share of university-educated individuals in the working-age population. Interestingly, so, too, did work-related materialism, yet only until the expansion reached 25%, then it gradually increased.

However, divorced grandparents and grandfathers in particular are less likely to provide care for their grandchildren. This article examines the reasons for this. Drawing on the literature on this subject, the authors first argue that divorced grandfathers are less likely than their married counterparts both to provide care and to provide care often. This may be because compared to married grandfathers they tend to: (1) have a larger number of children and grandchildren (because they often repartner after divorce); (2) live farther away from their offspring; (3) have less frequent contact with their offspring; and (4) be in poorer health. Using Czech SHARE (Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe) data from waves two and four, the authors show that divorced grandfathers in the Czech Republic are less likely to care for their grandchildren and provide frequent care primarily owing to the fact that they have less frequent contact with their children. The authors found no support for the assumption that the negative effect of divorce can be explained by the number of children or grandchildren divorced grandparents have, by their geographical distance from offspring or by their subjective health.","grandchild care provision, grandparenthood, grandfathers, divorce",czech,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.456332,3.7454233

City governance and administration are considered to be a part of a modern tradition of urban planning and city management, which is analysed in the first part of the study. The second, empirical part shows how 'common sense', ethnicised attributes are activated and applied to the localities and their inhabitants in the narratives of politicians and public officials. These attributes are associated with a notion of impurity, which leads to the need for surveillance, discipline, or purifi cation. From their analysis of these narrative practices the authors suggest that the borders of entitlement and the borders of responsibility are constructed. The borders of entitlement define who deserves the care provided by a state or a city; the borders of responsibility then delimit the symbolic space in which the state or city is perceived by its representatives to be responsible for the situation of its inhabitants and citizens. A crucial role is played in the process of border formation by (1) the application of ethnicised categories and inconsistent definitions of the objects of municipal and state care and by (2) the forms of ownership that apply to the housing stock in which these objects, that is, people, live.","social exclusion, space, urbanism, purification, ethnicisation, local government and administration, qualitative research, Czech Republic.",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.14011341151983653,0.09242336686621457,0,0.05427654242981291,0.07835539992084942,0.05443008480852908,0,0,6.5509276,3.599544

Using latent class regression analysis four distinct types of housework division and perceptions and individual characteristics that predict cluster membership of housework division are identified. The most prevalent type are couples in which there is a traditional division of housework and who divide further into two groups based on whether they view this division is fair or unfair. Cohabiting couples are more likely than married couples to share housework equally and to see this arrangement as fair.

It aims to understand why private rental housing is perceived as a sub-optimal housing solution for young adults, whether this affects their family plans, and which policy design could change that. The article uses qualitative research techniques to analyse mental frames, opinions, and attitudes of both potential tenants and landlords towards rental housing. The authors argue that the main problem of rental housing for young tenants is the short-term lease. Lack of mutual trust between tenants and landlords is a main cause of short-term contracts in the private rental segment. The insecurity it produces among young tenants contributes to delayed family formation. A policy tool aiming to overcome that distrust between tenants and private landlords through the involvement of an independent third party as a guarantor of the relationship is discussed.","housing policy, rental housing, focus group, young households, family planning, Czech Republic",english,Housing,households - regional - successful - household - private - barriers - prague - could - population - development,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.470294,1.7914227

The study focused on teenagers aged 14-17 'hanging out' in shopping malls in the largest Czech cities. The data were collected by participant observation and interviews.

The analytical framework used for this research is life course theory, according to which it is possible to approach the transition from youth to adulthood as a multiple transition. This point corresponds well with reality because young people follow at least three trajectories on their way to adulthood: from school to work, from family of origin to family of procreation, and from dependence to independence. The data necessary for the analysis were collected through repeated biographical and semi-structured interviews with 14 long-term unemployed graduates of non-GCSE vocational programmes and 6 employed graduates of vocational programmes as a reference group. Their implicit theories of adulthood, progress on the path to adulthood, and everyday strategies were examined in a qualitative data analysis, with special attention paid to contextual aspects. As for the dominant form of transition, the author found that long-term unemployment has a delaying impact on the transition to adulthood, above all owing to financial strain. These people suffer from prolonged economical dependency on their parents and remain at the threshold of the socially constructed path to adulthood.

The article’s theoretical starting point is Foucault’s question about ‘Who is speaking?’ as an important element of the archaeology of knowledge. The analysis was conducted by counting the frequency of public normative official affiliations the guests and moderators had in the discussions and performing a qualitative content analysis of the interviews carried out with the organisers. The analysis revealed that most of the participants were politically centrist subjects from centrist parties, the liberal and conservative media, and non-governmental organisations critical of the extremes in the media landscape. The discursive strategies analysed included procedures of exclusion based on the distinction between reason and madness, media routine, and the valuing of objectivity and respect toward the deceased over balance. However, balance is still an acknowledged value and could become the basis for more plural discussions, given that the respondents claimed that they have no problem with differences of opinion.","media, discussions, balance, discursive dominance, madness",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.09601779205035972,0,0,0.1789713781770083,0,0,0,0,6.694047,4.926041

It is hypothesised that one reason for this could be data heterogeneity. Both tested concepts could be valid, but for different social groups, resulting in overall inconclusive results. Therefore, latent class analysis (LCA) is then used to show that in the Czech Republic direct democracy is supported both by people alienated from politics and by those satisfied with democracy and democratic governance.

There is some inconsistency in support for the individual principles of market economics: support exists in post-communist countries for the notion that the state should be responsible for the social and economic well-being of its inhabitants and for state regulation of the economy, while support is high for some market economy principles, such as free competition and private ownership. In other words, support for some kind of social market seems to prevail among people living in post-communist countries, based on the notion that the state should combine a market economy with relatively generous social policies.","market economy, post-communist countries, free competition, private ownership, state regulation of the economy, welfare attitudes",english,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,TRUE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.6904545,5.8667345

However, it often ignores their organisational aspects. At the same time, in organisation studies there is a large body of literature that focuses on internal organisational structures but disregards working conditions. This article is based on a case study of supermarket cashiers and deals with the flexibilisation of their work. Firms use two forms of flexibility as a cost-cutting strategy: numerical and functional flexibility. Numerical flexibility divides workers into different groups according to their work contract. This enables firms to employ as much labour as they need at a particular point in time. In effect firms reduce the number of employees while intensifying the work of the employees they retain. In the case of functional flexibility the duties and responsibilities attached to a job are redefined. In this respect, I show that the duties of the cashiers in my case study are increased beyond the scope of tasks traditionally attached to this occupation and head towards the model of a universal worker. This shift leads to a decline in qualifications that, combined with technological changes, results in the degradation of work. As a result, flexibilisation processes deepen existing asymmetries in employer-employee relationships and thereby enable firms to transfer a significant amount of market risk onto the shoulders of workers. Moreover, the negotiating position of workers remains weak and their wages low.","flexible organisation, numerical flexibility, functional flexibility, precarisation of work, working conditions",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0.05823348208996732,0,0.05079638430399568,0.2927075970249947,0,0,0.0667236985122652,0,0,0,0,0.10655523607316376,10.264214,6.2410707

It begins by focusing on the understanding of power within the context of its first dimension, which is most vividly reflected in the perception of the World Bank as a dominant actor. The second part of the article concentrates on power in development discourse. The third part analyses disciplinary power in relations of 'development' cooperation. The fourth looks at agency, which disobeys the discourse and structure, in order to recognise the capacity for resistance among even the least advantaged. The final part focuses on governmentality and 'development'. In the conclusion the author attempts to make a brief synthesis of these approaches, on the one hand viewing power as a kind of strategic situation, but on the other hand arguing the importance not to overlook the enormous power of structure just as much as the capacity of certain privileged actors to influence it. What is important then is a subjectivity of power.","development, power, discourse, agency, structure, governmentality",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.5810636017435054,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.269271,6.4576416

Using some premises of Norman Fairclough's critical discourse analysis, the author attempts to demonstrate how homosexual and transsexual individuals (labelled using native categories such as homosexaulis, gayos, buzerantos, kerado, or tato) are identified, and how this process of identifi cation is linked to existing social practices. In the analysis the author focuses on analytical issues, including the problem of identifying buzerantos and the semiotic aspects of identification methods that can be observed in the context of conjunctural events of social practice. Other issues the author deals with include how this identification process relates to genre, style and discourse, how subjectivity is involved in discourse, and in what ways members' resources are changing the limits of discourse. The fi nal point analysed is the practice of homosexuality and transsexuality as an alternative discourse type, which challenges the strategies of stigmatisation and changes the classifi cation frames governing what is appropriate or inappropriate.","Roma, Roma settlements, identity, homosexuality, transsexuality, embodiment, critical discourse analysis, Slovakia",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.2246414687438866,0.05940659558243321,0,0.1405741702973302,0.06415020544236467,0,0,0,7.0466495,3.8601336

After introducing the concept of regeneration and regeneration theories and reviewing foreign cases of regeneration of problem neighbourhoods, the authors analyse the situation in Prague and attempt to answer three basic questions: How do the authorities in Prague approach social-spatial inequalities and urban regeneration in the city? What are the objectives of the city's regeneration policies and what tools are used? Who are the main actors involved in regeneration policies and how do they relate to each other? The study of documents and interviews with the people who are the actors involved in regeneration policies showed that the 'regeneration policies for problem neighbourhoods' in a post-socialist city differ significantly from the approaches applied in Western cities. In Prague regeneration policies do not rank high on the ladder of local political priorities, and local politicians implicitly assume that the situation in the city and its districts and neighbourhoods will improve, existing problems will be eliminated, and the city's inhabitants will see a rise in their economic and social status. A detailed analysis showed that the lack of emphasis placed on the regeneration of problem neighbourhoods is mainly due to structural factors. Socio-spatial inequalities in Prague are still smaller than in most otherwise comparable cities in the Western world, the spatial concentration of existing problems is not too great, and the spatial patterns of social and economic problems in the city do not overlap very much. Spatial concentrations of problems in Prague are thus far mainly found in a micro-local form, encompassing just individual buildings, clusters of buildings, or at most one to several blocks.","regeneration, residential neighbourhoods, post-socialist city.",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.09415985474184212,0.11137402001760816,0,0,0.14318080415968265,0.08226441420431435,0,0,7.00328,2.3063996

These changes in educational fluidity are driven by period (by institutional changes) rather than cohort effects (by cohort replacement). Period effect signifies both changes in the effect of class origin on educational attainment (class inequalities in education) and changes in the expansion of the Czech educational system. Both these period effects are presented as a part of the theory of maximally maintained inequality (MMI), which helps explain the changes in educational fluidity in the Czech Republic during the observed period.","educational mobility, cohort analysis, educational inequality, educational research, measures of inequality.",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.167018,7.888066

However, this implicitly assumed biogenetic basis of membership in a particular descent group is not evident in the case of kinship among inhabitants of a Roma settlement. The nature of their kinship can be described as the incorporative process of women and pristašis into descent groups. The fundamental criterion for an expectant partner in marriage is to be 'lačhe' (good, proper, appropriate). The division of people in a Roma settlement into two basic groups (lačhe versus degešis) does not mean that these people form endogamous groups defined by procreation. It is rather a matter of moral ideas about what makes people good or bad. Two complementary principles play an important role in these ideas. The first principle relates to the natural base, the second to the process of socialisation. In this respect, fajta does not just refer to a cognatic descent group, but also has another dimension, which cannot simply be defined in terms of procreation and which indicates a shift towards a common basis. This can be demonstrated in the example of pristašis, which is a long-term process of incorporation in which fajta, as the domain of nature, shifts to the frame of culture. Despite of the difficulty of determining whether people were born or socialised into a particular fajta, kinship in a Roma settlement should be studied within the wider organisational complex that on the one hand makes some people related and homogenous and on the other hand excludes other people from this relatedness.","Roma, Roma settlements, kinship, cognatic descent groups, nature, culture, Slovakia.",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.0739503684760264,0,0,0,0,0,0.05970876765669526,0,0,0,0,7.0691504,3.763183

Using the dataset Sonda Maturant 1998, the authors show that entrance exams based on general aptitude tests may outperform the field-specific knowledge model in terms of providing access to talented students from a lower socioeconomic background.

Although the number of children born increased noticeably, total fertility did not increase at the same pace, and its regional patterns remained rather stable. The most important factor that influences the regional variation in fertility is the education of women, particularly young women.

We provide a detailed interpretation of the model’s development and results, along with recommendations for building a model and solutions to convergence failure problems. One important finding is that one predictor of the exchange of expert information is ideological homophily, which reduces the potential of expertise to seek compromise solutions.

It identifies particular evidentiary concepts that do not easily fit into the standard ontology of formal asylum law. In particular, Czech court rulings tend to conceptually frame unconventional legal authorities (like elders, traditional councils) as cultural entities, non-state actors, or private persons, which paradoxically disqualifies them from the ontological possibility of posing (or preventing) a threat to refugees by operating an (in)effective legal system.

The model results support these hypotheses. Men are observed to prefer younger women, while women prefer men who are the same age or older than they are. Given that there are significantly fewer women on the dating site, they are the ones who choose, and the pairing result depends on whether they respond to a contact or not. The youngest women are contacted by men of all ages. Although men contact much younger women, they have a better chance of success with older women. Our conclusions are thus consistent with international research on homophily in the online environment and to some extent the results correspond to patterns of age homogamy in the Czech Republic.

Other important factors that we discuss are the intersubjectivity of emotions and the emancipatory potential of the initiative's organisational structure, which enabled the participation of people with no prior experience with activism. We also focus on the public's sense of disillusionment with civic engagement and with the political system in general since 1989. This research contributes to the study of tenant movements in postsocialist countries, which are often an overlooked actor in one of the most important processes in the post-1989 transformation - privatisation.

Despite fading from public discourse in the late 1980s, the notion of thrift had by then become instilled in the subjective understanding of the 'reasonable consumer', a concept that can therefore be considered a precursor of the contemporary concept of consumer responsibilisation.","thrift, saving, discourse analysis, socialism, consumers, consumer responsibilisation",english,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7.3712244,4.590353

This study contributes to this field of research by testing the potential of resilience as a capacity to adapt in the face of adversity through individual and social resources and is the first European study to investigate how resilience predicts survival in later life. Panel data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe are used to determine the predictors of survival among people over the age of 75 between waves 1, 2, 4, and 5. The results of a multilevel logistic regression show that resilience is a strong predictor of survival among the oldest old and that this is true even when controlling for the amount and severity of adversity. Resilience is found on its own to be a stronger predictor of survival in women, while the amount and severity of adversity is more important in men. Resilience is therefore found to be an important factor in longevity and survival in later life and the stronger effect of resilience in women can partly explain the 'gender paradox'. To sum up, resilience is observed to be protective against decease, especially through the use of social resources, which are stronger among women and which are not measured in most traditionally used resilience scales.","resilience, older age, longevity, gender, SHARE",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0.06518206805858577,0,0,0.1079380526113941,0,0,0.06983762062371351,0,0,0,0,0.06961258767885609,10.113795,3.2703946

It grasps the existence of manifold elements of the capitalist totality on a conceptually objective basis. Individual human subjects exist in and at the same moment against capitalist society; it is through them, as contradictory identities, that the class struggle is fought. Accusing Open Marxism of class reductionism is false, because such an objection fails to distinguish between formal (analytical) and determinate (dialectical) abstraction as two different tools for analysing social reality.

The authors argue that the persistent out-migration predominately of young and educated inhabitants is one of the key processes of the circular causal mechanism that leads to the marginalisation of particular localities and areas. Selective outmigration entails the disappearance of various socio-cultural activities, more precisely social institutions and civic amenities essential to maintaining or increasing the quality of human capital. Consequently, depopulation could have a severe impact on the developmental potential of a locality, and thus could significantly decrease quality of life in certain localities and particularly among certain social groups of the population. The article provides spatial insight into depopulation tendencies at several geographical levels, especially in the final decades of the last century.

The particular rules of the game - state regulations - led to the quick supply of new private rental dwellings, but at the same time they substantially constrained the long-term demand for this type of housing. Like in those advanced countries where a more dramatic form of private rental housing liberalisation occurred, in the Czech Republic the significance of rental housing quickly shifted to become a temporary and residual form of housing. This article is thus about the 'greenfield' establishment of a housing system and how initial state regulations create or modify the long-term social norms relating to housing tenures and especially to private rental housing tenure.","Czech Republic, housing system, private rental housing, transition economies, housing theory",english,Housing,households - regional - successful - household - private - barriers - prague - could - population - development,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.40207,1.8333243

The authors focus on factors that derive from the specific economic position of Prague and the specific culturally-rooted preferences of Czech citizens for owner-occupied housing.

The author shows that a prominent role in such processes is played by psychological essentialism. People represent some of their social identities as inherent qualities that are based on the sharing of a presumed 'essence': something unobservable, diffi cult to remove, irreversible, and causally responsible for overt behaviours. Empirical evidence suggests that no particular causal process of essence acquisition is constitutive for essentialism in folk models of society. Some authors believe that folk essentialism is necessarily connected with the presumed innateness of an essence (its biological transmission across generations). Innate potential and biological inheritance, however powerful they may be for the human cognitive mind in the domain of folk models for biology, are far from necessary in essentialist folksociological classifications. Essentialism in folk sociology is not defined by any particular causal process of essence acquisition. Even when it is possible to detect that a given group of people claim the innate essence of a particular folk sociology, it is always necessary to look for other features of essentialism (inherence, sharp boundaries, the immutability of identity, etc.). The article reviews some infl uential cognitive proposals concerning folk models of society (Astuti, Gil-White, Hirschfeld) and ethnicity, and provides arguments and empirical evidence collected in Western Ukraine in support of the claim that presumed innateness is not the constitutive part of folk models of society, let alone of psychological essentialism.","essentialism, folk models of society, ethnicity, Ukraine, social identity.",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.08903777336765344,0,0,0,0,0,0.05858239302215692,0,0,0,0,7.489018,5.693585

The questionnaire was administered to two groups of Vietnamese living in the Czech Republic. The second-generation group (N = 279) is made up of ethnic Vietnamese who were born in the Czech Republic and the 1.5-generation group (N = 119) is formed by ethnic Vietnamese born in Vietnam who came to the Czech Republic before they were 12 years old. Using Principal Component Analysis a more complex (six-factor) structure of Czech cultural orientation and a simpler (four-factor) structure of Vietnamese cultural orientation were extracted. The research revealed that the second generation is less oriented towards Vietnamese culture than members of the 1.5 generation, but the degree of orientation towards Czech culture is the same for both groups, and both groups are also oriented more towards Czech culture than Vietnamese culture. A comparison of cultural domains shows that Vietnamese from both generations have a better knowledge of the Czech language than the Vietnamese language, and they claimed to have more contact with Czechs than with Vietnamese people, but both generations also indicated that they were prouder of their Vietnamese cultural heritage than of Czech culture.

Homelessness is a fact that has various causes, and the article tries to link the factors behind and barriers to the successful reintegration of the homeless with potential state interventions in the area of housing and housing policy to reinforce the success of reintegration. Although effective housing policy assistance is not the sole precondition for the successful reintegration of homeless people into long-term housing, without such assistance reintegration is not possible. Despite the relative broadness of existing studies of homelessness in the Czech Republic, to date there is none that focuses on this dimension, and analyses the factors behind and barriers to the successful reintegration of the homeless in greater detail and in reference to the effectiveness of assistance from the housing policy sphere. The authors thus also assess existing public assistance to the homeless in the sphere of housing and innovative changes that could be made to this assistance in the form of 'guaranteed housing'. In order to analyse the factors behind and barriers to the successful reintegration of the homeless into long-term housing the authors draw on fi ndings from their own qualitative survey of social workers and homeless people conducted in the Czech Republic's three largest cities. Given that housing systems in post-socialist countries followed a similar path of development, the conclusions from this research could be of more general validity and could serve as resource for other post-socialist countries.","homelessness, housing policy, guaranteed housing, Czech Republic",czech,Housing,households - regional - successful - household - private - barriers - prague - could - population - development,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6907809520400567,0,0,0,7.554139,2.03577

The analysis consistently and persistently showed large gaps in health between children born to mothers with elementary education on the one hand and all other children on the other hand. While the trends are not entirely congruent across all measures of child health, the authors found more evidence of growing inequality than of declining or stable inequality. Inequality grew most in the 1990s and then stabilised or even declined.

The research indicates that the factors connected with the use of defensive practice to deal with parental conflicts have the opposite effect in the Czech Republic that that observed in international studies or have no influence whatsoever. Child protection social workers who emphasise compliance regard their working conditions as favourable and have somewhat conservative attitudes and beliefs. The authors' interpretation of the findings is that the emphasis on regulations in Czech child protection is not a defensive reaction to threatening working conditions, but an expression of loyalty to an organisation that offers them a pleasant work environment where they need not be afraid of any potential failures or consequences of their decisions. They also propose redefining Czech defensive practice by placing less emphasis on compliance as a reaction to unfavourable working conditions.","parental conflict, guardianship, defensive practice, social work",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.7939205,5.790413

Negative features included dissatisfaction with pay, poor leadership, and pressure to produce. Job satisfaction was significantly associated with traditional academic values (focus on quality, involvement in decision-making, commitment to the workplace, recognition), while stress was linked to market-related aspects (pressure to produce, quantitative work demands, job insecurity). The study highlighted relatively high levels of well-being among Czech faculty, which can be attributed to the continued prevalence of a traditional, professor-oriented academic system based on autonomy and collegiality.

The study conceives academic success and failure as categories that need to be explained; it is necessary to demonstrate how they are produced and ascribed with meaning in the everyday practice of student evaluation, especially by school authorities. Student evaluations are generally based on a complex assessment of a student's aptitude and diligence, and they also reflect a student's conduct at school conduct and attitude towards school discipline, education, and authority, i.e. towards accepted values, the school code, and other (written and unwritten) rules of interaction. Academic failure signalling some kind of shortcoming on the part of the recipient of an evaluation - be it a lack of interest, motivation, cooperation, effort, ability, or intelligence - has a moral connotation and stigmatising effect. This is legitimised by the presumption that it is the student's own deliberate actions, his or her degree of interest and effort, that determine success or failure at school, and that this essentially has nothing to do with the student's (natural) intelligence or (given) family background. Yet a student's family background and available cultural resources play an important role in academic performance. Academically inclined parents, high academic ambitions on the part of a student and his or her parents, communication style, and respect for school authority are key elements of success at basic school and have a hand in the intergenerational reproduction of educational inequalities.","school ethnography, social categorisation, school success/failure, educational inequalities, cultural resources, positioning.",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.345301117097158,0,0,0.05947094801605153,0,0,0.05969913728960895,0,0,0,0,0.06122967787749277,10.824515,8.201068

It does not conceive space as a dimensionless, empty, and homogeneous container but draws instead on the concept of place as unique and meaningful. The conceptualisation of place is thus based on the classic works of the humanist geographers Yi-Fu Tuan and Edward Relph, who consider place to be integral, enclosed, and determinable. The issue of the determinability of integral and still meaningful place is examined using Michel Foucault's concept of heterotopia. A certain place in a city is linked to a number of other places, which in a way then become present in that place. The place cannot be considered a homotopia but, on the contrary, is a heterotopia. Place can also be conceived from a temporal point of view. Various times (rhythms) blend in a place and they refer to processes that were taking place in other (even temporally very remote) times. Similarly, just as place can be spatially considered a heterotopia, temporally it may be considered a heterochronia. The term heterochronotopia is used to refer to a place that opens out both spatially to other places and temporally to other times. Empirically the article focuses on one selected place in the post-socialist and post-industrial city of Brno (Czech Republic). The article seeks to (1) identify links connecting the researched place to other sites and times and to (2) describe the selected place as a system of associations. The research combines a very wide range of methods such as direct observation, informal interviews, and analyses of historical documents, photos, public transport timetables, etc. The article thus offers an example of a dense description of a place as a temporally or spatially undeterminable entity, provides material for critical reflection on the assumption that urban place is enclosed and determinable, and introduces 'heterochronotopia' as a new concept referring to a spatially and temporally undetermined place in a contemporary city.","place, heterotopia, heterochronia, heterochronotopia, Brno",english,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0.7280054140325434,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.716777,3.4056716

The authors are guided by the assumption that it is necessary to analyse changes in both the structure and the perception of inequality and that the two are interconnected. They assume that some general differences exist as a result of the legacy of state socialism in the three post-communist countries, but also that significant differences exist between those three countries themselves that stem from their different paths of development in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the first part of this article, differences in the societal-political aims of a Western country such as Austria and those of state-socialist countries are discussed. The authors argue that the state-socialist countries were able to contain income inequality but were less successful at limiting other aspects of inequality. Austria, on the other hand, was able to avoid the severe income inequalities of the capitalist system by introducing democratic-corporatist institutions and a strong welfare state. In the second part of the article the authors investigate the subjective perception of inequality based on the ISSP inequality surveys. The majority of the population in all four countries think that income differences are too large, but there are significant differences in how people perceive and evaluate the stratification structure: in Austria, individuals rank themselves significantly higher than do people in the other three countries and see their society as dominated by the middle classes. The opposite is true in Hungary, where most people think that they live in a society characterised by a small elite, and they see the mass of the people at the bottom.","social stratification, inequality, Austria, state socialism, perception of inequality",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.27600307094177845,0,0,0.05172764117113908,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06872174403814653,4.5923996,4.6691623

It examines the patterns of social differentiation in the Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) and attempts to assess changes in the social structure at the subnational level. Social structure changes are explained within the context of broader socio-economic development. The main analyses performed in this study are based on EUSILC micro-data covering 2006–2016 and offer a comprehensive perspective on the patterns of social-stratification development at the regional level utilising three dimensions: social class (proxied by the European Social-Economic Classification), highest attained education level, and income. The results indicate different trajectories in social differentiation across the four countries, although some of the patterns identified are similar. The results indicate that the working class is shrinking and the salariat is growing, and that there are declining shares of people with at most primary or secondary education and increasing numbers with tertiary education. Income inequalities remained relatively stable over the observed period across the Czech and Slovak regions, but fluctuated in Hungarian regions, and the initially greater income inequalities in Polish regions have tended to decline over time. The findings suggest that the least favourable patterns in the development of regional social differentiation are found in the Hungarian regions.","social stratification, social class, income, education, regions, Visegrad countries",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,TRUE,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.205102,7.537515

While many Western countries have been experiencing declining or stable associations between class and electoral choice, we hypothesize that the trend in class voting should be quite different in the Czech Republic, and by extension, in other post-communist countries. We theorize that if a country is undergoing a process of re-stratification - the process in which class-based cleavages and identities regain significance in a new market economy after a long period of their de-stratification by communist egalitarian policies - such a country should also experience increases in class voting in the new market environment. Using standard loglinear and logistic regression approaches, our analysis confirms that class voting has indeed increased in the Czech Republic, particularly from 1998-2010. That increase is large both in the gross effect of class as well as its effect net of the role of other demographic variables. The Czech Republic is therefore relatively unique among countries examined in the international literature on class voting in having increasing associations across several electoral periods.","class voting, class politics, social stratification, politics in the Czech Republic.",czech,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.485098,5.7337327

The study is based on an analysis of semi-structured interviews, primary and secondary sources, and field observations. First, the following four positions taken by users as part of their involvement in the reform of mental-health care are identified: guardians, negotiators, awakeners, and fighters. Second, this study discusses the complexity of relations between users' participation and knowledge, showing that the key source of users' involvement is personal experience, which is difficult to separate from expert knowledge.

Structural modelling, based on representative data from the Czech follow-up to the PIAAC international research project (2015), reveals the validity of the links between values and personality traits, which is still sometimes overlooked in psychology. The relationship between values and personality traits is more complex than most psychological studies assume, as some personality traits that might be expected to have a strong cognitive component are influenced more by values, while others, vice versa, are weakly associated with values. A new hypothesis then is that the influence of values on traits largely occurs on a conscious level, has a decidedly cognitive basis, and may vary in the long term and change its polarity in response to strong confrontations with the social environment, while the strength and polarity of the influence of personality traits on values remains stable over time.","human values, personality traits, cognitive ability, PVQ scale, NEO-Five Factor Inventory, non-recursive structural modelling",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.14815202622268045,0,0,0.061753933067392,0,0,0.06471904995532578,0,0,0,0,0.09049547915126878,10.091145,7.1851006

In order to test equivalence, a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was used. The results of the analyses show that the configural and metric equivalences of all seven value types are valid in only 10 out of 23 countries. However, even in those 10 countries, it is impossible to fully rely on scalar equivalence. For more detail, in many countries it is possible to carry out valid comparisons of relations and value types, as well as of other value attitudes or socio-demographic indicators. However, it is not possible to compare national averages of the seven value types.

Success at achieving a work-life balance is examined both from a subjective perspective and in relation to the three basic social goals it is intended to facilitate: women's employment, people's reproductive plans, and gender equality. An international comparison shows that while the forms and success of harmonising family and professional roles in countries with different external factors have specific national features, people's subjective assessments of their ability to combine these two spheres of activity vary little among economically active partners. The reason for this appears to be that to some extent people adapt (more or less voluntarily) their harmonisation strategies to the external conditions in individual countries. Also, these strategies are influenced by national socio-cultural specifics and differences in the degree of acceptance of gender inequalities.","work-life balance, employment, reproductive behaviour, gender equality, family regime",english,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.775114,6.1142545

It focuses on the political opportunity structure (i.e. the structure of relationships that affect social and political behaviour) and questions whether this structure affects also women's political representation. It shows that women are significantly advantaged in municipalities where women have held a mayoral post in a previous electoral term. In contrast to other studies, previous women's representation in a municipal council is here found to have only a limited effect. The strong negative effect of the direct election of mayors and the negative effect of municipal size (only in Slovakia) indicate that women's representation as mayors may be the result of interdependent phenomena that are a combination of institutional structure (e.g. electoral procedure, the mayor's powers) and political contextual factors (past experience with a female mayor - not necessarily incumbents). This finding challenges earlier studies and it shows that any effort to identify a clear list of determinants of women's representation as mayors is a complex task, making it difficult to pursue a broader comparative study in a different institutional environment or a different political culture.","local politics, local elections, women and politics, women's representation, women mayors, Czech Republic, Slovakia",czech,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,0.2573639601406123,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06625185889534871,0,3.4174445,6.1753626

It presents a detailed discussion of the privatisation thesis in relation to the perceived 'loss of public space' and in relation to social exclusion, which many authors see as one of the key distinguishing features of privatised spaces. Many scholars regard shopping centres as the exemplification of privatised space. Therefore, this paper presents an empirical study of Czech shopping centres and focuses on the process of exclusion therein. Two kinds of exclusion are identified in the research. One is formal exclusion and it derives from the shopping centres' house rules, an analysis of which reveals their key features to be issues of control, an inherent ambiguity, and hidden personalisation. The second kind of exclusion identifi ed, an informal type, derives mostly from the preventive identification of 'unwelcome' groups, who are usually defined in terms of their physical appearance. Members of these groups, most notably homeless people, tend to be excluded from the shopping centres on the basis of a conflation of the meanings of security and comfort. However, the process of exclusion is in turn altered and negotiated by the personal power relations between the security guards and the excluded.","urban sociology, privatised space, exclusion, shopping centre, city",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.37638758141700984,0.08278830156470346,0,0.0741268422656871,0.0610046411151806,0.06509436125595285,0,0,7.8429914,3.9327965

Based on de Certeau's distinction between place and space, public space is analysed as a phenomenon transcending the material reality of a city. It is argued that public space is established in the process of interaction between the social reality of the city on the one hand and its regulative processes on the other. The former refers in particular to the phenomenological duality of urban public places, which are perceived as attractive and threatening at the same time. The latter includes internal and external processes of behavioural regulation. Following the classic works of Goffman and Lofland and current research on urban civility and interaction, it is argued that internal regulation establishes an 'urban order' that governs the rules of interaction and behaviour in the urban public space. In conclusion, an interpretative approach to the urban public space is suggested. In this view, the public space, while physically framed by the city's material reality, is itself a process of constant production and reproduction of shared meanings attached to places.

Most of the building's inhabitants are Roma, but the problem of cultural racism is interconnected with political, economic, legal, and even research and activist issues. The article is based on socially committed ethnographic research and the perspective of critical human geography. The theoretical framework is informed by the geographies of eviction, which grasp evictions as a becoming affective process. In this approach the focus is on not just the structural and other causes of eviction and its negative consequences but also and above all on the eviction that is taking place in the present and that temporally goes beyond the act of displacement - it signifies the lasting effect of sovereign power exercised through threats of eviction and 'home unmaking' brought about by the withholding of vital infrastructure. The analysis distinguishes four becoming phases. The first one shows how tenants' precarity is made when their stigmatisation as Roma intersects with the neoliberal imperatives of individual responsibility asserted by the town. In the second phase, the eviction begins, giving rise to affects of confusion, desperation, and fear. The third phase brings resistance to the arbitrary sovereign power of the town authorities. In the fourth phase the resistance sees some successes, but the town's sovereign power at the same time expands its spatiality.

It makes use of data from the Czech part of the International Violence Against Women Survey, which allows us to analyse the reporting behaviour of 709 female victims of IPV. The reporting rate among them is very low - only 8%. Logistic regression models of reporting confirmed the high relevance of the features of the particular incident and revealed also several factors related to the history of violence in the relationship; on the other hand, the victim's resources were found to have no influence. Distrust of the police proved to be an important factor for not reporting to the police (29% of women), and further analysis of this factor suggested the possible occurrence of learned helplessness syndrome among some victims.

She critically addresses the challenges that efforts to attain recognition for caring persons by including care as a labour-market activity are confronted with owing to the current changes in the social organisation of care under global capitalism, which involves among others the employment of marginalised groups of women and women immigrants in the caring professions.

The analogy is presented as an unusual and fun technique that breaks up the routine of the respondent's day-to-day life and is a contrast to the monotonous nature of common tests and questionnaires. Applying this exercise in social research is easy. Analogy obtains meaningful answers from participants and it provides valuable results.

These changes in reproductive behaviour noticeably coincided with the incentives that have been provided since 2008 by the increased flexibility of the parental leave scheme and the author argues that the option to increase the monthly amount of the parental benefit together with the flexibility of its use has contributed to the closer spacing of births, most notably among more educated women.","family policy, parental benefit, reproductive behaviour, birth intervals, education, Czech Republic",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.161751,6.0226064

Using both qualitative (interviews and archives) and quantitative (database) methods, it demonstrates that intermediation activities developed in the late 1980s with the arrival of American law firms, which exported their working methods to Europe. This led to a fierce competition between law firms, which tried to recruit from inside the European Commission. Circulation between the European institutions started to be common and slowly became regulated, a process that gave it legitimacy. While new activities developed for a part of the legal profession, most notably lobbying and intermediation activities, lawyers contributed to blurring the border between the public and the private sphere at the European level. The importance of circulation between the administrative sphere and law firms and the embeddedness between the public and the private sector are thus incentives for overcoming institutional frontiers when studying the European field of power. Because circulation facilitates the development of social networks, common practices, and shared representations, it is essential to maintaining coherence within this 'weak field'.","EU studies; sociology of professions, lobbying, revolving doors, political sociology of the EU, legal professions",english,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,0.13373380199735993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05015217730909236,0,5.1626906,6.45473

Empirical data obtained through fieldwork and interviews with representatives of the public sector and civil society suggest that while creating an illusion of inclusiveness and empowerment, the 'resilience approach' has largely ignored the structural conditions of extreme social and spatial inequality in Santiago. Local political realities and private sector interests play an important part in this equation.

It examines the factors that influence migrants' simultaneous negotiation of 'belonging' in the home and host societies. This question is particularly significant in the 'liquid' context of free intra-EU mobility. The analysis is based on semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in 2014-2016 with 41 Czech migrants who had moved to the United Kingdom in 1990-2015. Building on existing research of Central and Eastern European migration, the article shows that despite their diverse trajectories, most interviewees strive for 'grounded' lives with a family and a predictable future. Their sense of 'belonging' is affected by their reasons for coming to and staying in the UK, but especially by the presence or absence of agency; whether the migrant's decision to stay was voluntary or dependent. Aspects of the individual's migration situation and personal characteristics are also shown to structure migrant belonging. The concept of a 'leap of faith' is introduced to capture the role of a conscious commitment to settling in the host country, both physically and mentally, and thus re-gaining 'control' over one's migration trajectory in cases when the decision to stay was not made independently.","liquid migration, settlement, belonging, reasons for coming and staying, agency",english,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.7968535,3.179092

The Legacy of Czechoslovak Ethnography and Folklore Studies in Czech Anthropology,Nikola Balaš,female,"Faculty of Humanities, Charles University, Prague","One issue of the post-socialist transformation of Czech higher education has been the many attempts to establish an independent discipline of sociocultural anthropology. As many observers noted, the establishment of a fully-fledged Czech anthropology after the collapse of communism in 1989 proved to be a rather difficult task. Many accounts offered various explanations for the uneasy state of emerging Czech anthropology, but none of them focused on the specific academic practices that anthropology inherited from its predecessor-Czechoslovak ethnography. While anthropological names, books, and theories entered wide circulation and have become a regular part of curricula since the 1990s, the specific way ethnography is practiced has remained unchanged. The article looks at the Department of Ethnography and Folklore Studies at Charles University, which, in the 1990s, became one of the departments where students were able to take courses in anthropology. While the students were given an introduction to anthropological knowledge, they were not led to adopt the specific set of scholarly attitudes that are intrinsic to sociocultural anthropology, the most important of which is a specific approach to academic debates. It could be concluded that this uneven distribution of academic expertise, this disunion between knowledge and non-knowledge, may have severely delayed the development of an autonomous tradition of Czech sociocultural anthropology.","culture of contention, postsocialism, higher education, history of anthropology, history of ethnography and folklore studies",english,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.3714849293026406,0,0,0,0,0,0.05245673911884993,0,0,0,0,7.5923243,6.7758684

The analysis investigates the extent to which this is the result of a random process. Unlike previous analysis, the nadir in satisfaction (in Hungary) is found to occur midweek. This is explained as being related to workload. The results are robust after controlling for the interviewers' unobserved characteristics or the hour of completion of the interview. Modification in workdays owing to national holidays did not alter the results. The results reveal which social groups are especially vulnerable to fluctuations in satisfaction. This could have practical consequences for a more efficient work-life balance. The paper suggests questions for future research, which in particular should seek to understand differences between nations in terms of the nadir of satisfaction and to find a solution to the self-selection problem that may result in an underestimation of the true size of the weekly nadir.","weekly rhythm in satisfaction, day-of-the-week effect, mid-week effect, satisfaction with life",english,Methodology,quality - satisfaction - version - surveys - survey - value - effects - test - questionnaire - force,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,9.980751,6.444554

Combined with data on preferred employment regimes, the article explores the question of whether parents with higher levels of education and income are advantaged when it comes to their children attending preschool. The results show that the use of preschool facilities is relatively uniform across Czech households. While preschool attendance is not very common among children up to the age of three, after three years of age daily, full-day attendance predominates, with 94% of children aged five attending preschool. While there are no significant educational differences between mothers in the use of preschool care, there are when it comes to preferences. It is significantly more often university-educated mothers who are found to use institutional childcare less than they would like to, and it is they who are also more often found to be at home with their preschool-age child despite their wishes otherwise. Institutional provisions thus prevent women who would like to return to work earlier or work more than the system allows from pursuing their preferences. The results also show that access to institutional care significantly structures the income opportunities of households (rather than it being that households' income opportunities structure the use of care), and subjective assessment also confirm this.","ECEC in the Czech republic, educational diversification, social reproduction in education, mothers' preferences regarding preschool education",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.023114,5.8612423

It deals mainly with biopower and biopolitics as analytical concepts pertaining to the control and administration of the modern population, governmentality, medicalisation, and authoritative knowledge.

This analysis contributes to the discussion by offering recent evidence of both the rejection and the use of class-based classification in the discourse. The authors argue that the rejection of the notion of class goes hand in hand with the symbolic division of society into class-like groups.

Moreover, voter turnout and the share of invalid votes decrease substantially between the first and the second rounds of the Senate elections. This article enquires into the causes of the decrease. It builds on theories that emphasise the salience of elections and the decisiveness of voting and using data from all Senate electoral races between 1996 and 2012 tests several theoretical predictions drawn from these theories. Two types of regression models are employed to test these hypotheses. Surprisingly, the findings show that neither the closeness of the electoral race nor the presence of an incumbent or a communist candidate has an influence on voter turnout. The decrease in turnout between rounds and between electoral cycles is best explained by the fact that first-round elections coincide with other types of elections, and by the lack of ideologically polarised electoral races in the second rounds and the fragmentation of the first round contest.

The main thesis of the article is that the key tension in the current debate on global climate change is a dispute not between supporters and deniers of climate change, but between climate fatalism and administrative-expert rationality. The article shows that the environmental crisis is closely linked to and negotiated and discussed in connection with the crisis of administrative and expert institutions. A good illustration of the cultural aspects of the current drought debate in the Czech Republic is the link between the social and natural aspects of environmental problems and the different imaginations of both nature and society.","environmental sociology, climate change, expertise, discourse analysis, culture codes, media",czech,Environment,environmental - change - movement - values - crisis - behaviour - pandemic - postsocialist - private - eastern,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5.9452796,5.219618

The analysis uses the migration register and census data based on citizenship. The results suggest that foreign citizens are a factor in the transformation of the ethnic structure of the population especially in the inner city and the historical core. Ethnic segregation appears to be most pronounced among economically stronger and culturally distant groups, but concentrations of foreign citizens are forming on the level of localities rather than urban quarters.

After that he accepted a tenured position at a marginal non-research university and failed to gain an audience in wider American or international academia. On a personal level, he preferred to focus on his family and social work rather than to take part in the academic game. In this he was perhaps influenced by the bleak fates of two of his colleagues in exile, František Rouček (1891-1952) and Zdeněk Ullrich (1901-1955), both of whom gave priority to their professional careers, which took them to Africa, where they both met an early death.

One of the leading figures of early Czech sociology, Machotka saw the closure of Czech universities during the Second World War as an opportunity to carry out original empirical research devoted to the sociological analysis of the workforce and consisting of a study of the social determination of work efficiency. This was the first Czech, and one of only a very few European, empirically-grounded research projects in the sociology of work and occupation that had been conducted to that time. Machotka statistically analysed the vast data sets collected by the company's personnel department and provided a detailed interpretation of the outcomes, while remaining very much aware of the limitations of the results and the methods employed. He formulated hypotheses about how the age gap between spouses, the number of children in family, and other characteristics might impact (various aspects of) work efficiency, and reformulated existing hypotheses about the impact of siblings, marital status, and parental profession. Machotka also helped to theoretically and methodologically (re)orientate the sociology of work and occupations. Machotka subsequently abandoned this topic and quantitative sociology in general, perhaps in part as a result of the above-described research, which, the author suggests, led him to realise that 'abstract empiricism' was not the only method on which to base social studies.","sociology of work, work, work qualification, sociological research, Otakar Machotka, history of Czech sociology",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0.06078954048275714,0,0,0.08052653145741996,0,0,0.0523531743515444,0,0,0,0,0.1099798010950594,10.183124,6.2890086

The author provides a summary of all the articles, reviews, and information on the topic published in the journal and shows that, regardless of its importance within Czech sociological discourse at the various stages in the development of the discipline, the sociology of religion has generally had only a limited presence in the journal over the years, for both internal (sociologists of religion were not considered 'core members' of the sociological community) and external reasons (fear of what was considered a 'problematic' topic during the communist era and the non-existence of 'untarnished' students of religion after the collapse of the communist regime). The situation changed only recently, broadly speaking in the last decade, as younger generations seized the initiative and research on religion became a standard part of the Czech sociological mainstream. However, only a small number of contemporary sociologists of religion publish articles in the journal and, consequently, this sub-discipline is still far from being a consistent presence in its pages. The limited degree to which Czech sociology of religion has established itself in the pages of Sociologický časopis / Czech Sociological Review thus raises fundamental questions about the nature of the discipline, its students, and the broader sociological environment.","sociology of religion, Czech sociology, Sociologický časopis, Sociologický časopis / Czech Sociological Review",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.33722630035383167,0,0,0,0,0,0.06004212550476046,0,0,0,0,7.4227605,7.098206

He was one of a few sociologists who revived the discipline in the 1960s and was a talented organiser and a co-founder of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University in the 1990s. He was also a gifted teacher. However, owing to his busy organisational role, extensive teaching activities, and the publishing ban and restrictions he was subject to during the communist era, it is difficult to define the 'real Petrusek' in terms of his sociological thinking. The author argues that insight into his thought can, paradoxically, be found in the work he did during the most restricted period of his life, i.e. in the late 1980s, when Petrusek and his colleague Josef Alan published Sociologický obzor (Sociological Horizon), probably the only samizdat sociological journal in the world (1987-1989). In this journal Petrusek was not bound by external restrictions or his various other activities and he proved to be a particularly original analyst and thinker. He defined an 'alternative sociology', which was based primarily on the sociological analysis of literature and the performing arts as well as on his own profound knowledge of classical and contemporary sociology, which allowed him to shed light on a range of pressing contemporary social issues such as gender relations, the social perception of time and progress, the dissemination and dissolution of higher education, social stratification, and the approaching post-communist era. Petrusek contributed 83 different and, in the main, highly valued texts to Sociologický obzor that often drew attention to the crucial social issues of late modernisation (not only in reference to communist societies) and criticised the academic impotence of the 'official' Marxist-Leninist sociology of the time.","Miloslav Petrusek, Czech sociology, Marxist sociology, history of sociology, communist regime",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,TRUE,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.4698706,6.8161044

However, sociological inquiry and discussion found a home, at least temporarily, in various less regulated departmental, regional and technical institutes, which came to represent the 'grey zone' of contemporary Czech sociology, i.e. the space between official, state-sanctioned sociological work and prohibited, dissident sociology (and where a significant number of persecuted sociologists were able to retain their jobs). One such institute, the House of Technology inPardubice, played a particularly significant role in the 1970s and, to a lesser extent, in the 1980s. For a decade after 1969 it hosted the dissolved academic Department of the Sociology of Industry (V. Herstus, O. Sedláček, D. Slejška) and its research activities, the former Institute for Social Analysis (from Hradec Králové), and a further 20-30 external (part-time) workers. The House of Technology conducted around 150 empirical surveys, especially in the fields of the sociology of work and the sociology of organisation and published a number of books in the field of sociology and its own journal, Analýza (Analysis), which in the first few years presented theoretical discussions and later the results of empirical research. In this article the author provides a broad analysis of the organisational background and results of the various activities of the House of Technology, which, whilst significant in terms of Czech sociology at the time, were, the author concludes, unable to serve as an effective substitute for real academic work. Indeed, it was more a research than an academic institution and the main contribution it made to Czech sociology was the professional 'life jacket' it offered persecuted scholars.","House of Technology in Pardubice, Czech sociology, history of sociology, communism, sociology of work, sociology of organisation",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.37007564185800473,0,0,0,0,0,0.05752692238091619,0,0,0,0,7.5706706,6.6901813

Lectures in sociology commenced at Charles University in the 1880s, the first professorships and departments of sociology were established in 1919, and sociology was fully established as a doctoral discipline twelve years later. All the other universities in Czechoslovakia (with the notable exception of the German University in Prague) followed suit (usually after five or so 'test' years), as did polytechnics and independent colleges specialising in social studies, where, admittedly, attempts to establish departments of sociology were only partly successful. Using archive sources, this article analyses in detail the various processes involved in the establishment of sociology at individual universities and colleges, describes the forms and content of sociological education offered and conducts a prosopographical analysis of students in this field. On average, five students graduated in sociology in Czechoslovakia each year during the interwar period, and the number of dissertations written in sociology experienced a real boom shortly after the Second World War. The number of annual graduates rose to 23 between 1945 and 1948 and to 42 between 1948 and 1953, and this despite the fact that after the coup in 1948 the communist regime declared sociology a 'bourgeois pseudoscience'. Consequently, only a very small number (5 percent) of the post-coup graduates were able to apply their sociological knowledge in their careers, and most of those who were able to did so rather late in their careers; the great majority of earlier graduates were not allowed to apply their knowledge at all. However, in Czechoslovakia it was nothing new for graduates of sociology to be unable to apply their education in their field, since the interwar and immediate post-war academic elites were made up largely of graduates of other fields, who were often unwilling to make room in academia for their younger colleagues.","Czech sociology, study of sociology, sociology students, history of sociology",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,TRUE,0,0,0.3764696944697023,0,0,0,0,0,0.05474176218342205,0,0,0,0,7.617781,6.696405

Mertl was a follower of Max Weber and focused on the comparative historical-sociological analysis of political partisanship and party systems. He also devoted extensive study to changes in the relationship between state administration/bureaucracy and political representation. He enriched the field of (Czech) sociological theory with his concept of the 'self-regularity of social phenomena', dealing with the unintended outcomes and latent functions of social action, and he attempted to distinguish between Weberian ideal types and 'historical types'. He also made the first systematic analysis of modern bureaucracy, using the Weberian concept of the 'iron cage of modernisation'. However, Mertl is a significant figure in the history of Czech sociology for another reason: his behaviour during the Second World War is generally perceived as an explicit example of collaboration with Nazism, which led to Mertl's total exclusion from the academic community after the war. The author analyses the motives and extent of Mertl's 'wrongdoing', as well as the reasons for his being ostracised by the academic world, even though he was officially acquitted of collaboration.

Šíma became a member of the somewhat ""thin on the ground"" national sociological academia of the interwar period and specialised in the sociology of sexuality, religion, and education. However, his research was often the result of his own religious and church positions, which were connected with the so-called free Christianity movement and which cannot be accurately judged according to contemporary standards. Šíma's star rose spectacularly during the Second World War, when he became the undisputed leader of Czech sociology, notwithstanding the fact that his influence came at the price of making considerable compromises with the Nazi regime, and owing to this and his own personal failures he assumed a rather low profile in the immediate post-war years. Šíma had another opportunity to shine following the communist coup in 1948, when he immersed himself in the ideas of the new regime. Seven years later he committed suicide. The author analyses Šíma's fate and his writings as a case study in the context of the evolution of Czech sociology and outlines its weak points as well as the events which contributed to the outstanding but unlikely success of this 'maverick' of sociology (the discipline's weak organisational background, with conformity to special interests, personal grudges between top figures in the field, and methodological incompetence flourishing in its place).","Jaroslav Šíma, Czech sociology - 20th century, sociology and politics, sociology and power, sociology of religion.",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.8323419990249459,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.3678894,6.784917

However, in a quantitative analysis of the inter- and intragenerational reproduction of church attendance categorical variables may have some disadvantages and limitations. This article discusses and tests the possibilities of a different methodological approach, where ordinal variables indicating the frequency of church attendance are transformed into numerical-type variables. More simply put, respondents are asked how many times a year they attend church and this information is expressed in a new variable. There are a few analytical advantages to this numerical variable. First, the information on the frequency of church attendance is not divided up into multiple categories and can be transposed for use in multivariate analysis. Second, even if there are only a small number of cases in the data set there is no need to reduce the categories of variables. Third, the results of the analysis can be presented as a single numerical value. The individual examples in this analysis focus narrowly on the rates of inter- and intragenerational reproduction of church attendance, and the analytical possibilities of numerical variables on attendance rates are tested on data from the Religion module of the International Social Survey Programme 2008.","frequency of church attendance, methodology of quantitative religious research, numerical variable, intergenerational and intragenerational transmission",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.22066460748780709,0.05325898820990209,0,0,0,0,0.06446506168436208,0,0,0,0.05510666060808939,7.726964,7.5201006

Drawing on qualitative research carried out in the Wroclaw subzone of the Walbrzych Special Economic Zone in Poland, the article explores the question of the identity of migrant professionals in the context of their connection with places. It analyses how migrant professionals perceive both their place of origin and the place they currently inhabit and considers the specific practices migrants engage in to strengthen old bonds and establish new ones. Despite their high mobility, migrant professionals cannot always be described in terms of placelessness belonging. On the contrary, migrant professionals show a relatively strong connection to their place of origin and some of them attempts to form ties with their current place of stay.","transnational professionals, highly skilled migrants, belonging, place, Poland",english,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.1089735,3.07324

This period moreover constituted a golden age in sexology in the country. Sexual science developed as a holistic discipline, embracing achievements in medicine, psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, history, and religious studies, providing recourses for sex education and therapy. Sexuality was perceived as multidimensional and embedded in relationships, culture, economy, and society at large. This approach was fundamentally different from the biomedical model, which started to develop rapidly in the United States after Masters and Johnson's publication of Human Sexual Response in 1966. Contemporary feminist critics like Leonore Tiefer point out that Masters and Johnson's approach initiated the process of biomedicalisation and commodification of sexuality and led to the domination of pharmaceutical industries in sex therapy. Meanwhile, owing to the given political and economic context, socialist sexual science was not tied to the market and remained holistic until the advent of capitalism in the 1990s. Along with the invention of Viagra, the free market significantly reshaped the field of sex therapy, giving priority to pharmacotherapy, promoting new sexual dysfunctions, and marginalising other forms of treatment. Nevertheless, Polish sexology was not fully transformed. It proved surprisingly resilient to the influence of pharmaceutical industries and the holistic approach to sex therapy remains highly valued and often practised; pharmacotherapy is perceived as insufficient and sexual dysfunctions, including erectile dysfunctions, are frequently treated using psychotherapy, which takes into account not only psychological but also social, economic and cultural issues. This article is based on the author's ethnographic and archival research on the development of Polish sexology since the 1970s. She focuses on the relationship between sexuality, socialism, and capitalism and shows that an analysis of socialist sexology sheds light on the nature of the contemporary hegemonic understating of sexuality and sex therapy.",": history of sexology, history of sexuality, post-socialism, gender roles, Poland",english,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,0.4866919145195654,0.08639573834316859,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.308949,4.7777195

The hidden agenda in this criticism is political: the charges are that Parsons supposedly disavows democracy in his implicit or explicit knowledge aim, and that his sociology presumably makes society function even at the expense of freedom of the individual. Here the author argues that these accusations cannot stand if archival materials such as lecture notes, correspondence, and unpublished memoranda are taken into account. She claims that Parsons in his sociology conceptualised society from the standpoint of the real world of the day, including the major historical confrontations from the 1930s to the end of the 1970s. The first such scenario and the earliest confrontation that his work faced was in the era of the New Deal and the Second World War as the Anglo-Saxon democracies fought the racist imperialism of Nazi Germany; his 'middle phase' from the 1950s to the mid-1960s coincides with the Cold War at its height, the standoff between the capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union; and his 'late oeuvre' has yet another agenda, namely the Watergate Affair, but also the struggle for racial equality and university reform in the United States. In his theoretical positions and in his opposition to his critics, Parsons defended liberal democracy against the powerful social and intellectual forces that put it to the test.","Talcott Parsons, history of sociology, American sociology, system theory, public intellectuals",english,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.3337391823582438,0,0,0,0,0,0.0682502116935878,0,0,0,0,7.3212705,6.2064004

It is possible then to distinguish: peripheries characterised by low qualifications, lower living standards, and the absence of a middle class; peripheries with an increased risk of social exclusion; peripheries with poor accessibility; and peripheries facing demographic challenges. Differences in the spatial patterns of the four types of peripheries indicate that different sociospatial processes contribute to the emergence of different types of peripheries and this calls for varied public policy tools and measures.","peripheries, disadvantage, area deprivation, public policy, rural areas, social exclusion, Czech Republic",czech,Rural,spatial - areas - rural - differentiation - patterns - demographic - social exclusion - cities - population - socioeconomic,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6.541564,2.0356507

The primary factor influencing the level of integration of Ukrainian migrants is the length of residence in the Czech Republic. Household composition and the residential preferences of Ukrainians play a secondary role. On average Vietnamese immigrants have resided longer in the Czech Republic, but the increasing length of residence has a much weaker effect on the level of socio-cultural integration of members of this community. The residential preferences of Vietnamese immigrants and especially the age at which they arrived in the Czech Republic are important factors in their integration. Those Vietnamese immigrants who arrived as children are significantly more integrated than those who arrived as adults.

The article summarises some of the theoretical assumptions of developmental analyses of small rural communities, its development factors, and the current focus of contemporary Czech research. For many rural inhabitants their local community is the main space of everyday activity, and the development, stagnation, or decline of the community's functions or changes in its socioeconomic and cultural characteristics significantly impact the inhabitants' quality of life. However, searching for relevant developmental potential and, in particular, measuring the impact of such potential are complicated tasks because there is a lack of data for firm comparative analyses. This article aims to explore the internal structure of developmental potential and statistically measure its impact. Therefore, the author presents a model of local development consisting of structural and locality-based factors, endogenous developmental potential, and developmental indicators. The model is tested on a set of statistical data for individual small rural communities in the Czech Republic using factor analysis and multilevel modelling, where the regional data are used as independent variables on the second level. The empirical results confirm that it is possible to define several distinct types of endogenous developmental potential and to identify their impact on development, which is rather weak. The relatively high intra-class correlation coefficients of some community characteristics indicate the existence of specific regional patterns of community capacity and development in small rural communities in the Czech Republic.","endogenous developmental potential, community development, rural communities, small municipalities, community capacity, rural development, Czech Republic.",czech,Rural,spatial - areas - rural - differentiation - patterns - demographic - social exclusion - cities - population - socioeconomic,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6.510939,2.034586

Set against primary research, represented by two case studies, the article shows how families that practise home schooling enter the game of capital, how they justify their decisions, and how they negotiate their difference. Based on personal practice these families contribute to the overall transformation of the field of education. Given that they do so not from the position of a lobbyist or a movement leader but from a position where they are convinced of their ideological and action isolation, the author concludes that it is possible to consider here a parallel with cultural creativism.","home schooling, anthropology of education, ethnotheory, cultural creatives",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0.05369643853377116,0,0.05130634393429893,0.1076344772474086,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06966930752446719,10.047249,5.379265

However, only 3% of them said explicitly that they had been sexually harassed. One of the reasons for this contradiction is the relatively low awareness about sexual harassment in Czech society. Even in academic debates, a narrow definition of sexual harassment is often preferred and the gender dimension of the problem is not considered. With this in mind, the authors discuss expanding the concept of 'sexual harassment' to include a gender perspective. They demonstrate the use of this concept in an academic setting and the outline main methodological challenges faced by the relevant research. Against this backdrop, they identify two contentious aspects of the conceptualisation of sexual harassment: (1) the relationship between 'objective' and 'subjective' definitions and (2) the relationship between expert and personal definitions (scientific and lay's definitions).","sexual harassment, gender harassment, universities, objective and subjective definition, expert and personal definition.",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.06879619540371577,0,0,0.06225086955160617,0,0,0.05346836918406922,0,0,0,0,0.06900835187086761,9.200638,5.527748

This article examines the social structure of the residents of large housing estates in Poland and identifies the main trends in current social changes. The time frame of ongoing transformations in the social structure was set around the turn of the 21st century. This analysis is based on Polish 1988 and 2002 National Census data, the Polish PESEL population database (2011), and the author's survey data (2010-2012). Research was conducted in seven housing estates in fi ve Polish cities or towns (Poznań, Kraków, Tarnów, Dzierżoniów, and Żyrardów) and focused on analysing the sizes and types of households and their economic situation and the social structure of the estates. Results showed that large housing estates continue to have a heterogeneous social structure and to resist social deprivation processes. Depending on the period when a particular estate was built it is possible to observe distinctive features of housing estates, such as social structure renewal in housing estates from the 1950s and 1960s, residential ageing in those from the 1970s, and the risk of an exodus of young residents from estates from the 1980s. Those shared problems may soon become decisive for the future development of large estates.","large housing estates, neighbourhood change, socio-spatial change, mixed heterogeneous neighbourhood, post-socialist city",english,Housing,households - regional - successful - household - private - barriers - prague - could - population - development,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.176926,1.7223057

The study is grounded in a constructivist approach in rural sociology, emphasising the multiplicity of meanings ascribed to the rural by stakeholders. The study highlights the identity politics produced by rural development programmes and the implications these have for defining regional borders and for the very notion of 'rurality'. Commodification gives rise to a sphere of cultural economics, whereby the past and natural and cultural heritage are sold on the market. The establishment of a certified brand of regional products is an important tool of cultural economics. Two layers of identity are traced in the study of this process (and of the activities of the LAG in general).

This approach here makes it possible to analyse and distinguish several other concepts of the sociology of religion that can be used to take a more differentiated look to the often all-encompassing application of the concept of secularisation, which both embraces and diminishes Weber's multidimensional concept of 'disenchantment' (Entzauberung). Drawing on Niklas Luhmann's concepts of 'segmentary differentiation' and the 'surplus effect', the author attempts to formulate a radically different sociological concept of religion based not on a substantive definition of its sacred content but on the historical sociology of action, whereby religion can be interpreted through its specific focus on 'meaning' as a particular type of social relationship and its corresponding 'chance' (Weber) of understanding. Other cultural (and political) phenomena of modern society (confessionalism, political theology) whose applicability and effect are not explained away or exhausted/voided by the secularisation theory can also be analysed as 'religious'. To provide these phenomena with a context the author uses the term 'religious culture' to aggregate of everything people of a particular period know and think about their religion, how they evaluate it, and to what degree they identify with it. The pluralisation of religion can then be demonstrated not just on a surface level (for instance, in term of the rise of new sects, client cults, and cult movements, participation in various spiritual and esoteric activities), but more generally as the potential or real presence of specifically religious phenomena in the public space and as a particular type of social relationship: both between actors reciprocally, and between actors on the one hand and institutions on the other, and finally also between institutions.","sociology of religion, secularisation, Entzauberung, Max Weber",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,TRUE,0,0,0.2995869640290094,0.05187620422479014,0,0.05046149502469995,0,0,0.07029982434164082,0,0,0.05000113412007451,0.05392345053370508,7.445891,7.177067

This article takes a dynamic look at the position of older workers in the labour market by investigating transitions between employment and unemployment using a sub-sample of older workers (50 year and over) from the Czech EU-SILC, who were interviewed repeatedly in a panel survey between 2004 and 2009. The authors use survival analysis methods to study the time-dependence of transitions into and out of unemployment and both with and without covariates. The results suggest that older workers are not at a higher risk of exiting the labour market (compared to other age groups), but once they are unemployed, their odds of getting back into employment are significantly lower. Even when controls (such as education level) are included in the model this disadvantage persists. Interestingly, while education generally protects people from labour market exit, this protective effect is weaker among older workers.","employment, unemployment, older workers, survival analysis, Czech Republic",czech,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0.0745831080843723,0,0,0.1110042589891423,0,0,0.07543882301443904,0,0,0,0,0.07619439464137504,10.850994,7.0926914

First, it briefly summarises what reforms have been introduced and describes their internal contradictions. The author argues that these internal tensions stem not just from the introduction of 'new public management' ideas into a completely different context, but also from the fact that the conceptual bases of one of the key objectives of these reforms - greater accountability - are internally contradictory. To understand these inconsistencies, the author analyses the various meanings of 'accountability' and shows how the term differs from 'responsibility'. He then examines the understanding of accountability as a type of social relation. The author also distinguishes the different forms that accountability can assume and defines the incompatible objectives and expectations that tie them together. In the second part of the article the author analyses reforms in the EU-10 and formulates three theoretical propositions on the nature of accountability and its potential consequences: (1) too much accountability operating in too many directions can lead to professional disorientation; (2) too much emphasis on the assessment of outcomes at the expense of an assessment of processes, which can result in a phenomenon that the author calls 'the institutionalisation of conformity'; (3) the asymmetry of accountability, i.e. the uneven distribution among different actors of the responsibility to account for actions, which can generate a reduced sense of fairness and legitimacy.","sociology of organisations, public sector, accountability, responsibility, new public management, EU-10",czech,Politics,political - support - postcommunist - participation - principles - countries - parliamentary - economy - postcommunist countries - citizenship,FALSE,0.1322730939185191,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05001616287981546,0,5.176819,6.3655987

The results show that in Romania the manifest variables of food choice criteria are split into two latent constructs: quality related aspects on one hand and price on the other, while in the majority of other countries price enters the same axis as quality. Thus, on the macro-level it is possible to conclude that Romanians' food preferences have their roots in two sources and fit a quality vs price model. An investigation of the socio-demographic determinants of these two preference criteria confirms the role of Bourdieu's distinction regarding the influence of social class on these preferences. In Romania, like in the rest of Europe, the price preference is associated with a precarious socio-economic status, while the preference for quality seems to be a habitus specific to a higher social status. The most salient difference between Romania and the two country groups is that in Romania neither age nor gender and only socio-economic background and place of residence have an influence on the studied preferences.","food consumption, quality cues, price-constraint, social status, distinction, Eurobarometer, Romania",english,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.05130390040990392,0,0,0.6188544651331167,0,0,0,0,8.038825,4.8483825

The nannies are usually recently retired women who welcome the opportunity for daily (paid) activity. Close daily contact between a nanny and a child leads to the formation of kinship ties: the nanny becomes the child's grandmother, and the cared-for child becomes the nanny's grandchild. Drawing on in-depth interviews the author examines these intergenerational relationships and focuses on how the nannies and the children understand these relationships in the context of their biographies. To this end the author poses two questions: How does the kinning process between nanny and child occur? What is the meaning of the established kinship ties for the Czech grandmothers and their Vietnamese grandchildren? The main argumentation is based on the assumption that children need grandmothers and women need to be grandmothers. The author argues that both of these needs are fulfilled in the daily practice of caregiving and thereby in the formation of strong emotional ties that in many respects override the biogenetic ties. In this particular case study, paid caregiving is found to give rise to new kinds of kinship relations and to enable women and children to be active parts of an intergenerational relationship. The unique case of ties between migrant families and Czech/native-born women also serves as a potential way of reconceptualising grandparenthood, grandchildhood, and intergenerational relationships.","grandparethood, grandchildhood, caregiving, kinning",czech,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,0.5621651462081566,0.05139722473675674,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.45098,3.822081

A related question, and one with policy relevance, concerns the role of education in women's deep-rooted preferences and individual concepts of life-success. A third question is to what extent higher education helps women to overcome social barriers to implementing their choices between job (career) and family (household), barriers that mainly derive from the prevalence of conservative values and low labour-market flexibility. The authors carried out a comparative analysis of 25 European countries using data from the second round of the European Social Survey (ESS2) collected in the year 2004. The results of multilevel modeling reveal that education not only significantly reduces the tendency towards conservative values and strengthens openness to change - more significantly with women than with men - but simultaneously helps women overcome the social barriers in the formation of their work-career preferences, particularly in countries with stronger barriers.","values, education, gender, modernisation, preference theory, work orientations",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.0838736750679923,0,0,0.07997406199317149,0,0,0.06563096043263934,0,0,0,0,0.11700721140146536,10.366196,7.440635

Given the multi-mediated nature of contemporary moral panics and in contrast to conventional analysis focusing on newspaper coverage this article is based on Polish migrants' self-reported experiences. Moral panic claims making about Polish workers 'taking British jobs' and 'abusing British social benefits' are perceived by the respondents themselves. Our analysis is in line with Sean Hier's conceptualisations of the interplay between individualised risk management and moral panic claims-making, which are manifestations of conflictual sites of the contemporary neo-liberal project of prudentialism. The article argues that the anti-Polish migrant campaign in Britain after 2004, which dramatised Polish migrants as 'stealing the jobs' of the native population, cannot be properly analysed as an irrational ethnic bias or an elite-engineering panic but is rather an expression of the destabilising effects of employment insecurities within Western risk societies.","Polish migrants, moral panic, employment insecurities, moral regulations",english,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.05891721789730294,0.34483939945183795,0,0,0.0514677425929424,0.05327202846048097,0,0,5.7772408,3.588244

As a prolific and wide-ranging scholar whose many works failed to find an enduring place in American sociology, Stark is a prime example of academic marginalisation. The authors analyse Stark's major contributions from the standpoint of the sociology of knowledge. They argue that his ideas regarding human nature, the need for social discipline, and the desirability of community were rooted in a pervasive biographical marginality that found resolution in his conversion to Catholicism. In turn, these ideas reinforced the marginality from which they emerged. The reception of Stark's work in the United States was governed by a perceived incompatibility of his outlook with the assumptions and goals of his American audience. In particular, Stark offered an explicitly value-directed sociology, one which asserted the importance of social order, individual discipline, and universal community, at a time (the 1960s and 1970s) when the field sought to maintain its credibility as an objective scientific discipline in the face of growing challenges from sociologists and non-sociologists alike. Stark's American colleagues focused on aspects of his work that were incompatible with their own cultural and disciplinary orientations and this obscured the full range of his achievements, especially his analyses which anticipated contemporary sociological work.","Werner Stark, marginalisation, religion, culture, social bond, values, sociology of knowledge, Catholicism",english,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.5865813804455333,0,0,0,0,0,0.06379240652759346,0,0,0,0,7.326615,6.495539

This paper extends both the Simmelian and functionalist versions of media by: (1) precisely defining the concept; (2) examining its two forms-a specialised institutional language and as an external referent of value; (3) elucidating the three modes of orientation various media impose; and (4) extending the function of media beyond (social) exchange to include other institutional processes such as communicative action, performance, and ritualised interaction. Ultimately, a reconceptualised theory of generalised symbolic media offers sociology a mechanism that simultaneously highlights the diversity found across institutional spheres, as well as the limits humans have in dealing with the problems posed by differentiation.","generalised symbolic media, institutions, integration, emotions, cultural sociology, morality",english,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7.320843,5.1712704

The Ukrainian healthcare system has remained largely untouched by post-socialist reforms, but it is nevertheless undergoing profound changes. These changes are occurring on the level of everyday practice and are shifting responsibility away from the state and onto the individual. The author traces how physicians navigate the persisting structures of the old system, and what hopes they carry for the present and the future. Post-socialist health care is bursting with competing interests, commitments, and notions of how health-care providers should relate to each other, their patients, administrations, and the state in general. This article therefore draws on physicians' narratives of the disorder in health care through the interpretive prism of 'ruination … as a process that weighs on the future and shapes the present' and that represents a 'vital reconfi guration' [Stoler 2008: 194] or crafting of 'hope' [Lindquist 2006].","health care, physicians, social change, post-socialism, Ukraine",english,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.986056,4.474621

Although some emigrate for long periods of time, many return after a few months or years abroad and re-enter the Czech health system. The nurses' narratives in this study draw on experiences in Czech, British, and Saudi hospitals to explore the role standardised medical policies, procedures, and protocols play in the development and maintenance of a nurse's professional identity in the post-socialist context. The author suggests that performance of protocols versus informality of practice in health-care settings provides a lens through which to view professional identity in post-socialism. In fields such as health care, standards operate as measures of security that create normative rules of governmentality, regulate behaviour, and prevent harm. The nurses in this study describe the majority of Czech hospitals as lacking standard protocols for patient care. Encountering strict rules of practice in foreign hospitals leads them to evaluate the professionalism and quality of Czech health care and their own selves as nurses. Their assessment is often based on their own ability to effectively perform within the standardised system. The author's primary analysis for this presentation will concentrate on the ways that standardisation relates to ideas about professionalism and nursing autonomy and status.","governmentality, health care, migration, post-socialism, Czech Republic",english,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.955418,4.4078474

The author argues that the principal reasons for medical travel to Poland are the lower costs of private treatment, the relatively easy access to specialised health care, and personal comfort derived from linguistic and cultural competency. The women in the study who travelled to Poland for medical treatment combined the economic resources acquired while living abroad with their knowledge of the cultural and medical system in Poland to choose the best options for them. The treatments they sought included gynaecological, dental, and other specialised treatments, for which they turned to the private health sector in Poland. Some of the women also sought treatment in other countries. The women in the study highlighted the advantages of medical travel and mobility while also reflected on the dilemmas they faced in choosing the best care. The author argues that medical travel poses a challenge to the national borders of health-care systems and the national availability of medical procedures, and found that while such mobility generates inequalities it also leads to greater agency and creativeness on the part of patients when they challenge the given regulations, authority, and expert knowledge in one country.","medical travels, migration, health-care systems, cross-border health care, Poland",english,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.965109,4.389072

Discussing the narrators' birth-care requirements she notes the strategies women use to attain the form of care they wished. Finally, the author observes that the women she interviewed exhibit diverse understandings of birth care, on which basis the author identifies five distinct notions of birth care that differ in three key aspects: (1) women's attitudes to medical interventions; (2) their awareness of birth care; (3) their subjectivity and position in relation to birth-care providers. These ranged from complete acceptance of the way in which birth care is provided, to notions that are critical but accepting of medicalised care, to a rejection of the medical model of birth care and the assumption of 'a responsible consumer' subjectivity. The article in particular looks at women's disillusionment with birth care and interprets it in relation to clashing ideas about the relationship between birthcare provider and user associated on one hand with the socialist past and on the other with neo-liberal discourses on health.","birth care, neo-liberalism, post-socialist, paternalism, Czech Republic",english,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.045744,4.585106

Beneš's sociology had an instrumental role in the formation of Czechoslovak national identity, most notably with respect to the construction of social boundaries of 'us' and 'them' in relation to Germans (especially between Czechs on one hand and Germans on the other), and it offered objects of national identification typical for the national movements of small nations and specifically of Czech society.

The comparison is performed on three levels: institutional affiliation (affiliation with a university, a learned society, and the publishing platform of a journal); objective conceptual agreement or variance (the degree to which general sociological theories, methodological opinions, evaluative judgements in science are shared); and subjective affiliation with a certain school (the existence of declared support for one school over the other, the antagonism of 'us' versus 'them' in reviews and debates, ties between a teacher and a student). The opposition between the two schools is most apparent on the institutional level and to some degree on the level of subjective affiliation. On the level of conceptual agreement within one school and opposition to the other, a number of alleged dichotomies and differences are found to be more a myth than a reality. The biggest difference found on that level is a greater inclination towards quantitative methods in the Prague school and towards qualitative methods in the Brno school. As it is impossible to generalise these and other characteristics, the author argues that the concept of academic schools in Czech interwar sociology is best understood using the paradigm of ideal types, rather than as a reflection of a real dividing line, and additionally, for a description of reality, by applying the concept of centre and periphery employed in subculture studies.","Czech sociology, history, 20th century, Brno sociology, Prague sociology, scientific schools",czech,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.3723440964639157,0,0,0,0,0,0.05356949023195546,0,0,0,0,7.5929675,6.671658

In terms of thematic structure, the majority of texts published in Sociologická revue focused on domestic and foreign sociology. Another prominent theme was the nation and nation-related issues, with texts devoted to the analysis of German fascism, national liberation struggles, and Czech-Slovak national co-existence. Broad thematic areas included the somewhat interrelated topics of crisis, rural areas, work, and politics and democracy. Texts devoted to the theme of crisis tended to focus on the period of the Great Depression, but crisis was also examined in a much broader than just economic sense. The theme of rural areas underwent a transformation over time and particularly after the war was replaced by the theme of folk and folk culture.

Alexander's cultural sociology. It shows that, in Alexander's work, the relative autonomy of culture is conceptualised in two different ways: first, as an analytical autonomy that is part of a multidimensional model of social action, and second, as the formal autonomy of a semiotic system that dominates in the more culturalist strand of Alexander's work. The author claims that Alexander's attempt to move in his work beyond a merely analytical autonomy of culture towards a fuller view of autonomy brings mixed results. Both concepts of the relative autonomy of culture assert an internal logic of culture, but the semiotic variant offers a much more developed account of what its internal structure is. However, the drawback of the semiotic view is that it tends towards the position of an absolute autonomy of culture or cultural idealism, which is difficult to reconcile with an adequate view of agency. The related proposal, first formulated by Anne Kane and endorsed by Alexander, to distinguish between the analytical and the concrete autonomy of culture is internally contradictory, for once culture becomes concretely enmeshed with social life, culture's autonomy dissolves. The central weakness of the concept of the autonomy of culture is identified as the insufficiently developed explication of the internal mechanism through which culture and action are linked.

The overview starts with the functional definitions (descriptive and socio-cultural) typical for the positivist and modern period of rural studies. Descriptive and sociocultural definitions derive from the rural-urban dichotomy or continuum, and the rural space is defined in relation to cities as non-urban space. Since the 1980s the political-economic approach has significantly influenced rural studies, transformed them into a more critical science, and introduced a definition of the rural as a locality. This definition, however, only became accepted when it was combined with a definition of the rural as social representation. That definition is a product of the cultural turn in rural studies that has occurred since the 1990s, when post-modern and post-structural approaches penetrated rural studies and promoted fruitful scholarly discussion that then positioned rural geography firmly among other geographical sub-disciplines. Current hybrid approaches to the conceptualisation of rural space combine both material and ideational definitions of the rural and include also rural practices, through which the material and the ideational rural are interlinked.","rural space, definition, rural studies",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.43050907423684215,0.08860595294171654,0,0.09660063378208038,0.07986919403082383,0.06043165921322214,0,0,7.386825,3.657892

In this paper, the author shows that the theory of taste developed in Distinction is one concerned primarily with the origins and only secondarily with the functions of taste. The author further argues that this theory is inseparable from Bourdieu's practice-theoretical project; it therefore cannot be coherently understood or evaluated unless it is presented in those terms (with habitus as the centrepiece concept). To that end, the author engages in a close reading of the basic argument in Distinction and shows that, according to Bourdieu, there is a tight (dynamically adjusting) relationship between tastes, conscious preferences, practical anticipations, and accumulated competences. Likes and dislikes function as partial glimpses into the store of practical capacities for cultural appropriation accumulated by a person. Most importantly, tastes operate via practical anticipatory action and not by conscious regulation. The author closes by outlining the implications of Bourdieu's 'scandalous' proposal for future research in the sociology of taste.","habitus, taste, Bourdieu, distinction, practice",english,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.06041109483701479,0,0,0.513079704091573,0,0,0,0,7.8755884,5.0288577

Rudoltice near Lanškroun in Pardubice is a specific case of a municipality that chose to prioritise extensive municipal housing construction. The municipality used government subsidies to construct a new neighbourhood called Zámeček, which, with its nearly 1000 inhabitants, caused the local population to double between 2006 and 2009. In this article, the author explores the roots of this large-scale project of municipal housing construction by specifically combining its national, regional, and local contexts. The local municipality's decisions and its ambitions and expectations for growth and prosperity were embedded in the micro-regional context of the successful economic transformation and development it had experienced since the 1990s and were made possible by changes in national housing policies and the devolution of policy decisions to the municipalities. Using the concept of (new) socio-spatial formation this article analyses the neighbourhood of Zámeček as a case of residential segregation. It argues that, even though its population is still relatively heterogeneous compared to other segregated localities in the Czechia, the neighbourhood is being shaped by an ongoing process of segregation. The specific supply of affordable housing in Zámeček meets a demand for housing from low income households in other regions where municipalities do not provide affordable housing.","housing policy, municipal housing construction, residential segregation, new socio-spatial formations, Czechia",czech,Housing,households - regional - successful - household - private - barriers - prague - could - population - development,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0.06174390210940291,0.0859645454231154,0,0,0.3916606756423434,0.05887722750097056,0,0,7.0124235,2.08012

The findings of a quantitative survey involving a representative sample of 820 residents in the two biggest Slovenian cities-Ljubljana and Maribor-show that, first, three types of digital exclusion exist: digitally unmotivated with high cultural capital; overall excluded with weak cultural capital; and digitally self-excluded with moderate cultural capital.

Born in Berlin, Coser had to leave his homeland for political reasons and he spent the years before Nazi Germany's invasion of France in Paris. Coser then fled to the United States and started his academic career there at the College of the University of Chicago. An abridged version of the PhD thesis he wrote at Columbia University was published as The Functions of Social Conflict, which earned him recognition, a promotion, and made him a figure of authority for sociologists in the 1960s. In this article the author draws on archival materials to examine Coser's life, major publications and achievements. His intellectual trajectory from Marxism to Mertonian Functionalism, his strong commitment to a Weberian view of the separation of politics from scholarship, the breadth of his erudition in literature and classical sociological theory, and his lifelong place in New York intellectual circles and intellectual magazines made him an extraordinary figure even amongst his contemporaries.","Lewis A.

The case of the attack on Liberty Square and on the Memorial of Soviet heroes in Budapest is analysed by defining hidden meanings narrated by different carrier groups.

In addressing this question, this study argues that systematic differences in institutional trust are related to salience. Institutions with high visibility or salience to the public, i.e. government, lower chambre and president, will be trusted on the basis of their perceived political and economic performance. In contrast, institutions that are less salient to citizens are not evaluated on the basis of performance but on more diffuse criteria. Competing models of trust are divided into two groups. Top down explanations emphasise what institutions do; and hence focus on political and economic performance. Bottom up accounts of institutional trust refer to social mechanisms such as values, culture and knowledge. The empirical results presented in this study reveal that trust in salient political institutions is more strongly shaped by political performance. Otherwise, there is no systematic pattern to the determinants of trust in political institutions. These results suggest that citizen trust in political institutions emerges from a variety of top down and bottom up mechanisms, where salient institutions are different in that they are evaluated more on the basis of the political performance of office-holders.","institutional trust, differential trust, levels of governance, salience, political sociology, Czech Republic",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0.13006074877064933,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06191128673483957,0,4.091569,4.6250772

Sociological and institutional explanations have been used to account for party system nationalisation. Both of these explanations have generally made causal inferences using aggregate data. The link between party system nationalisation and the individual voter has not been examined in the same detail. Here this link is explored using an ecological inference analysis of vote switching. This research, using the Czech Republic as a case study, shows that the presence of high party system nationalisation evident across a pair of elections may be associated with nonuniform electoral swings.

This is because the results of spatial analyses of roll-call data from the United States are interpreted in terms of ideological preferences. Within Europe party discipline is also a central feature of legislator behaviour. Consequently, spatial models of roll call behaviour in European legislatures should be explained in terms of party cohesion and discipline. This means that the correct interpretation of spatial models of roll-call data in places such as the Czech Republic requires access to additional sources of empirical evidence such as parliamentary survey data in order to make valid and reliable inferences about what motivates legislative behaviour. Using roll-call and parliamentary survey data from the sixth legislature in the Czech Republic (2006-2008), this research demonstrates that spatial models of roll-call data are not readily explainable in terms of party cohesion and discipline.

Erickson, Mark van der Maas, Andrew D. Hathaway",female,University of Toronto; University of Guelph,"Deterrence research has evolved considerably since the 1970s when a favourite offence for study was the emerging phenomenon of widespread cannabis use among mainstream populations. The deterrent model of crime prevention has expanded far beyond the study of objective and subjective indicators of certainty and severity to encompass social support, moral evaluations, peer involvement and, most recently, risk sensitivity and situational factors. Most earlier research found no evidence of deterrence of cannabis use, a fi nding attributed to its low actual and perceived risk of arrest and changes in public attitudes. This interview study with adult experienced cannabis users drawn from a representative survey base in Toronto, Canada, where possession is still treated as a criminal offence, provides a more nuanced interpretation of deterrence. The authors found that users had generally inaccurate knowledge about the current law and penalties and believed they would avoid arrest in the future. However, they were not oblivious to the possibility of police intervention, and took precautions such as carrying small amounts and avoiding public use. Thus, users were not unaffected by the law, but rather these discreet practices illustrate the operation of restrictive deterrence, shaping their choices of when, where and how to commit the crime of cannabis use. Further research on deterrence should examine situated choices by risk-sensitive offenders, and should also include cross-national patterns of arrest and user risk perceptions. While cannabis continues to be prohibited by international treaties, the reality of widespread use presents opportunities for innovative deterrence studies into this normalised yet illegal crime. The variation in policies, penalty structures and enforcement across European nations, compared to those in other Western jurisdictions, can foster relevant research for a transatlantic discussion about global drug policy transformation.","deterrence, cannabis, drug policy, drug arrests, public opinion, cross-national comparisons, Canada",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05986277492566367,0,0,8.728629,4.3648944

Although it is not easy to establish a firm definition of individualisation, most researchers studying demographic phenomena work with the concepts of differentiation and de-standardisation. If we understand individualisation as a structural fact and leave aside its subjective component (individualised identity is not necessary linked to structural changes), it must initially emerge on the aggregate level in the form of the differentiation of life courses or the different timing of transitions. For example, individuals begin to marry and have children at different ages. It then becomes apparent at the individual level in the form of the de-standardisation of the life course, thus not just as a change in timing, but also as a change in the order and realisation of individual transitions. For example, the birth of a child does not necessarily occur after marriage. So it is not just shifts in timing that are of interest - these have already been sufficiently studied in Czech demography - but also and above all the comparative distributions of these demographic phenomena. In this article the analysis works with two life transitions - marriage and first-order births - and using time series from 1920 to 2004 the authors examine the dispersion in timing of these transitions over a large segment of the 20th century. Using more detailed data from the post-1989 transformation period, in addition to dispersion the authors also examine changes in the intervals between marriages and births and education as a factor in the observed phenomena. As a key indicator of life-course differentiation they use the dispersion in marriage timing and its trend over the 20th century, and as an indicator of the de-standardisation of life courses in the 1990s they use the interval between marriage and first-order births.","birth timing, marriage timing, individualisation, life course",czech,Partnership,marriage - partnership - family - gender - division - transitions - partners - status - families - sociodemographic,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.667311,6.667856

The sociology of youth has traditionally operated from two distinct perspectives concerned with either 'youth transitions' or 'youth (sub)cultures'. This polarisation has led to the neglect of the experience of mainstream youth, who cannot be easily pigeon-holed into the above categories. Drawing on a series of focus groups and small-group semi-structured interviews with 61 young people, the authors analysed young people's experience of consumption in the Czech Republic. Using the experience of young consumers, the research attempted to understand what it means to belong to the mainstream. The results indicate that belonging to the mainstream does not imply straightforward compliance with dominant power structures, but rather reflects a degree of reflexivity in which young people challenge stereotypes of passive conformism in complex and often paradoxical ways that are not yet well accounted for in the literature. The article suggests that the notion of 'mainstream youth' offers some potential as a conceptual way of understanding young people's relationship to social change in what appears to be an increasingly individualised society. At the same time, this notion provides an alternative approach that challenges many of the assumptions underpinning the sociology of youth's conception of consumption.","mainstream youth, cultural and structural approach, individualisation, consumption, brands, conformity, negotiation, focus groups.",czech,Culture/Media,cultural - capital - media - distinction - young - mainstream - mechanisms - criteria - practices - theory,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7.700842,4.715505

Maternity as such is considered the natural and expected role of women and is part of the construction of femininity in Slovak society. At the same time, it is expected and routine that Slovak women participate in the labour market, and the prevailing form of employment is full-time work. This complicates efforts to harmonise work with the need to care for a small child. It is not just the country's legislative and institutional framework that shape notions about caring for small children; they are also influenced by the views and attitudes of society towards this issue. The image of a good mother is constructed, and women then try to approximate it when performing their maternal role. The prevailing ideal is of a mother who devotes herself full-time to caring for a child for the first three years of the child's life. The author of this article focuses on the context surrounding the construction of the image of a good mother as one who cares for her child until the age of three, and examines how the image of the good mother is reflected in the opinions of women on returning to work and on work/life balance. The data in this analysis are drawn from public opinion polls about early childcare and the reality of caring for small children in Slovakia and from in-depth interviews with mothers of small children. The mothers are aware of the views of society, reflect on them, and many try to fulfil them so that they are perceived as 'good' and not 'inadequate' mothers.","motherhood, parenting, care for children, gender roles in family, Slovakia.",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0.05548759072241219,0,0.06993003828841952,0.5638079473230643,0,0,0.08149511359504473,0,0,0,0,0.07088611216224808,11.017054,5.612596

Instead of following the demographic behaviour of their mothers why do these women postpone motherhood to a later age or remain childless? What do the life courses and reproductive strategies of contemporary women over thirty look like? The qualitative research discussed in this article is based on in-depth interviews with primaparas over thirty and their childless peers conducted in order to examine the dynamics and character of their decision to become a mother. The research applied grounded theory and identified five different types of reproductive strategies: 'to have a child no matter what', 'to have a child with the right partner', 'waiting for the right time', 'hesitating over whether to have a child or not', 'not having a child'. Consequently the specific sources of these strategies were described. Background family experiences combined with the experiences from the period of childlessness in adulthood can lead to the development of an 'individualised habitus', which can block the transition to the motherhood phase. In the Czech context the development of an individualised habitus can be strengthened by the unequal distribution of gender roles in the family of origin as well as in partnerships in adulthood.","women over thirty, reproductive strategies, family and partnership, individualization, gender equity, Czech Republic.",czech,Gender & Work,child - children - working - mothers - women - gender - men - work - conditions - equality,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0.7972158670717794,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.337678,5.3503666

The hypotheses are tested using matched panel survey data on respondents' personal agendas and using a content analysis of the media in relation to one particular issue. The selected issue - the restitution of property to the Catholic Church - was chosen because it contains a rich combination of frames. Moreover, this is an issue on which it is possible to study the effect of a 'focusing event', which may have an additional and distinct effect in addition to the 'regular' frames. The authors show that differently framed news do indeed have distinctive effects on personal agenda-setting. Some frames have a strong positive effect, while others have no effect. They even identify one frame that appears to have a slightly negative net effect on personal agenda-setting.

The author developed a scale based on a definition from the American Psychiatric Association (DSM IV-TR) and it is intended for use in standardised sociological surveys of non-clinical populations. The author tested it in two surveys: a pilot survey (N=141, snowball sampling) and in a representative survey of the Czech Republic (N=1081, quota sampling). The resulting parameters (17 items, the common factor exhausts 47% of the variance, Cronbach's alfa = 0,926) indicate that the test is more reliable than other instruments used to date (NPI, NPI-16) and owing to its smaller scope is also easy to use in questionnaire surveys. Intensive questioning confirmed the scale's validity and produced results that correspond with the findings of psychologists focusing on this issue. The author inductively arrived at an auxiliary typology of narcissism. In the text he distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary narcissists, the characteristics of which are described in literature published to date. The findings presented in the article support the view of cognitive psychologists (e.g. J. Beck) who interpret narcissism as a 'defective cognitive scheme'. However, given the scope of the phenomenon measured in the Czech Republic (narcissistic features can be observed approximately from the eighth decile), narcissism cannot still be viewed as just a marginal and pathological phenomenon. On the contrary, it is necessary to approach it as a phenomenon that has a strong social aspect and also plays a significant role in how modern society functions. In the Czech population narcissistic features are most often observed among the young generation (aged 18-29), childless, singles and people living in communities with more than 5000 inhabitants. As well as identifying narcissism as a socio-cultural phenomenon the article also demonstrates the relationship between the observed phenomenon and homosexuality.","narcissism, scale, social changes, culture, identity, homosexuality.",czech,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.16046435334736828,0,0,0.0622299490515887,0,0,0.06757660101509577,0,0,0,0,0.08760885324072482,9.787642,7.3363533

The analysis is based on representative data for the Czech population over the age of 20 drawn from the European Social Survey Round 4 and the International Social Survey Programme 2003. It shows that self-categorisation into the verbally defined age groups of young, middle-aged, and old is indeed common. It also reveals a much stronger level of peer group self-identification among the youngest and oldest respondents, despite the low social status of these age groups. The article closes with a discussion of the varying significance age has as a source of social identity and the invalidity of the hypothesis that age group identification is dependent on the social status of its members.","age, age identity, social identity, social status, ESS, ISSP, Czech Republic.",czech,Gerontology,care - age - old - women - health - roles - body - active - relationships - role,FALSE,0,0,0,0.3290878447533158,0,0,0,0,0.05734875276686168,0,0,0,0,9.907624,3.4857228

Thirdly, a brief summary of critical accounts concerning democracy's actual failures and symptoms of malfunctioning is presented. In the final section, two families of institutional innovations that are currently being proposed as remedies for the observed deficiencies of democracy are explored: those leading to a better aggregation of given preferences of the citizens and those aimed at improving the process of preference formation itself. It is the latter, which constitutes the field of deliberative politics that is investigated at some length.

Proselyting is analysed as an instructed action and as a situation in which one party is initially aware of the category of encounter which is to take place, while the other party (or parties) is not, and it is necessary to create the particular type of encounter and then to execute it in some effective and beneficial way as defined by the first party. I examine the types of order to which both parties orient in these situations, i.e. local and extended sequential order, topical order, and categorial order, as they are layered in the doing of the instructed action. The findings demonstrate that, as opposed to the lay perception that religious missionaries simply recite learned passages and phrases in doing their proselyting work, their activities in fact involve complex sequences of communicative work which require the utilisation of experience, tacit knowledge, and creativity. In addition, while it is possible to flesh out and describe a clear sequence of phases in FCPP encounters which, from the outsider's perspective, constitute proselyting, there is little which otherwise differentiates it from other types of activities involving talk.","missionaries, LDS Church, instructed actions, proselyting, ethnomethodology, conversation analysis",english,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.33138049077889614,0.05957837289274943,0,0.05585505618028658,0,0,0.0763325266370294,0,0,0.05641281344688055,0.0631980436167615,7.550704,7.371394

If quality evaluation focuses solely on sampling error, most aspects of data quality are ignored and surveys are assumed to have 'ideal' statistical characteristics that are rarely attainable in the pragmatic world of survey fieldwork. A complex overview of the entire process of data collection provides a more solid foundation for evaluating data quality. Under this approach, quality is ensured by controlling the whole survey process. Accuracy, which is commonly elaborated using the concept of survey error, ceases to be the only dimension of quality. Nevertheless, this data quality component is crucial for data analysis and statistical testing. A comprehensive approach to survey data quality requires us to take account of complex sample designs when evaluating sampling error and to identify and distinguish between different dimensions of nonsampling error. Analysts who are not directly involved in data collection have limited ability to obtain information necessary for data quality evaluation. There are two types of quality standards: administratively imposed standards (ISO20252:2006) and the technical and ethical criteria of professional associations (e.g. ICC/ESOMAR, AAPOR/WAPOR, SIMAR).

Even the large political parties do have enough members to put together candidate lists in most municipalities without the help of candidates not affiliated to any political party. This article demonstrates the cogency of distinguishing between two types of non-party politicians. First, there are politicians (candidates, councillors) who are not members of any political party but take advantage of the opportunity to run for them. Second, there are independents who run either independently or on the candidate lists of associations of independent candidates. While similar in many respects, there are also important differences between the two. Independents are more frequently women and people who before November 1989 were not members of the Communist Party. Compared to political party members, non-members are often elected on the basis of preference votes, but have smaller ambitions and often do not stand for re-election. A new finding is that a not insignificant number of political party members began their political career as independents, before joining a political party. The article draws on data from the international survey Municipal Assemblies in European Local Governance (MAELG), which concentrates on the recruitment, political careers, values, attitudes and working conditions of councillors in municipalities with a population over 10 000 inhabitants.

A civil initiative called Reconstruction of the State was heavily involved in the process. Before the 2013 elections, the initiative prompted the candidates running for an MP mandate to publicly commit to supporting selected legislation proposals. The initiative used a variety of advocacy and campaign tactics to support passing the bills after the elections. This paper uses process tracing to answer the following research questions: (1) What path led to this success?, (2) Is there sufficient evidence about the actual role of the initiative in seeing the proposals passed by the Parliament? and (3) What has determined the initiative’s advocacy decisions? The first research question is treated descriptively, focusing on the key milestones in this historically unique advocacy campaign. To answer the second question, we conducted a non-formal counterfactual assessment of whether the absence of the initiative would have resulted in passing fewer proposals.

NGOs Supported by the CEE Trust Are Still Largely Dependent on External Financing After 20 Years,Dalibor Jurášek ORCID...,male,"Faculty of Education, Trnava University in Trnava","Large-scale funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) by states and corporations (external funding) can impact their functioning and diminish their civic character. It is therefore of importance to understand whether and how NGOs can become financially independent of external funding. In Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), many NGOs were kickstarted by large sums from foreign state and corporate sponsors with the hopes of creating an independent civil society reliant on domestic sources: a ‘vibrant civil society’. However, did these NGOs become financially independent? This article examines a sample of 14 NGOs in Slovakia financed by the Trust for Civil Society in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE Trust), an organisation started by six private American foundations. Their funding is compared year by year, and it is found that between 2000 and 2020, foreign funding decreased from 97.2% to 55.2%, and corporate funding dropped from 92.1% to 31.2%. However, public sector funding increased from 1.2% to 35.6%. Civic funding remained low over the entire period, rising from 0.1% to 8.6%. Thus, external corporate funding was largely replaced by another type of external funding (public funding), and the role of one major foreign donor (the Trust) was largely replaced by another major foreign donor (European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) funds). The results suggest that it is difficult for NGOs kickstarted by external funding to achieve financial independence, at least on a timescale of 20 years.","civil society, non-governmental organisation funding, financial independence, civic funding, income diversification",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0.10891246020145208,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.05485269143923417,0,4.104322,4.640242

To obtain information on the main arguments for and against restitution, we selected two mainstream daily newspapers, the centre-right Lidové noviny and centre-left Právo, and the ‘official’ church media of the two largest churches seeking restitution in the Czech Republic: Katolický týdeník, the official paper of the Roman Catholic Church, and the monthly Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren magazine, Český bratr. All selected sources covered the 1990–2019 period. Our analysis of the media debate helps to determine why restitution in the Czech Republic – an interesting case given that it is perceived as the most atheistic country of the Visegrad Four – took its unique direction. It took more than twenty years for the churches to receive their relatively generous compensation and, at the same time, become separated from the state. Linking the theoretical concept of discursive depoliticisation with an argumentative analysis allows us to show that emphasis of the spiritual contribution of churches to society did not play a key supporting role in legitimising the restitution. The enactment of restitution was aided by two widely shared, morally oriented depoliticised sentiments: a neoliberal emphasis on private property and efficient management and an emphasis on the defence of constitutionality reinforced by anti-communist sentiments.","restitution of church property, argumentative discourse analysis, post-communism, Czech Republic",english,Knowledge/Science,religious - knowledge - work - culture - autonomy - world - articles - communist - power - science,FALSE,0,0,0.49747007508417007,0,0,0,0,0,0.05734529483181239,0,0,0,0,7.312417,7.0151863

The paper is based on research realised in Brno, the second-largest city in the Czech Republic, and uses qualitative, ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews with immigrants from non-EU countries who applied for a long-term residence permit. The paper examines time politics within this process, highlighting its unpredictability, disrupted temporal linearity and chrononormativity. In this context, the respondents describe the waiting period as a moment of being in between - temporally, spatially and socially. Therefore, I argue that the time politics experienced throughout the application process significantly influences the lives of applicants. The interviews revealed that the applicants were caught in a liminal position with an uncertain ending, exemplified by the impossibility of moving (temporally, spatially and socially) - a feeling often described as stuckedness. Consequently, this time politics and the temporal inequality and disadvantages experienced during the process contribute to exclusion from mainstream Czech society and produce structural invisibility.","time politics, waiting, chrononormativity, bureaucracy, migration",english,Others/Unclassified,institutions - exclusion - pandemic - public - schools - local - study - institutional - political - qualitative,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.1806585894019813,0.11472405107808302,0,0.06710387675416515,0.09345019120133204,0.06713254425080276,0,0,6.5383797,3.547424

These attitudes have often been attributed to few contact opportunities with actual Muslims in the country and, thus, public overreliance on the highly negative representations of 'Muslims' in public discourse. However, empirical qualitative assessments of the stereotypes which guide many Czechs' anti-Muslim prejudice and the effects of intergroup contact have been neglected. In an epistemological shortcoming, the survey category 'Muslim' has often been treated as one of analysis rather than of practice. Contrarily, I argue that Czech participants' contingent understandings and racialisation of the category need to be reclaimed as the ontological basis of prejudice. In this study, I relied on the results of a larger constructionist thematic analysis of 31 semi-structured interviews with non-Muslim Czechs and, regardless of citizenship or ethnicity, Muslims living in Czechia conducted in 2020 and 2021. The results show that, in line with public discourse dynamics, 'Muslims' in Czechia are commonly understood as immigrants racialised through their perceived Arabness, Middle Easternness and non-Whiteness. Furthermore, perceptions of Western European 'Muslims' as highly conflictual are juxtaposed with the fragility of Czechia in the face of immigration. Against this backdrop, I examine the mechanisms through which intergroup contact enriches participants' social cognitions of 'Muslims' - namely, subgrouping, positive stereotyping, reduced perceived intergroup threat and anxiety, and (re-)humanisation.","Islamophobia, social cognition, intergroup contact, stereotypes, public opinion",english,Migration,transnational - networks - towards - attitudes - ties - eu - cultural - attitudes towards - home - majority,TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0.05680132824478772,0.35010776640607905,0,0,0.05037164040743609,0,0,0,5.86608,3.5898185

Little is known, however, about MENA citizens' social capital and its composition and distribution across socio-economic groups. As an advanced foundation on which to build future analyses, we propose a stochastic approach for measuring people's social capital using Bayesian clustering, based on three dimensions: level of social activity, quality of social networks, and trust. Applying the method to the 2000-2014 World Values Surveys for 16 MENA countries, we describe the composition and distribution of workers' social capital within and between countries, and estimate ordered-probability regressions of workers' employment outcomes as a function of the dimensions of social capital, workers' demographics, and subjective health assessment. We find that, among the three dimensions of social capital, social trust is most clearly conducive to the employment and full-time status of both genders. The level of social activity is associated with more autonomous, intellectual and creative occupations among men, but only with more creative occupations among women. Higher-quality social networks are associated with more autonomous jobs, but also less creative ones. Interestingly, trust is associated with non-autonomous, manual, and routine jobs. In creative jobs favoured by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, workers are selected from those with higher socializing levels but inhibited networks and trust.","employment vulnerability, Middle East and North Africa, social capital, World Values Surveys",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.252927606534492,0,0,0.07732939567062436,0,0,0.06873871034979119,0,0,0,0,0.0773157676809096,10.774608,6.9035974

Based on previous literature, we consider justification for euthanasia, abortion, and in vitro fertilisation as a latent variable using European Value Study data from the 2008 and 2017 waves. Five European societies were analysed: Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Russia. All the countries observed showed growing levels of justification for these practices, although significant differences were found in the value orientation effects and respondents´ background variables on attitudes towards life and death issues. In order to properly address comparability, multi-group confirmatory factor analyses across countries and across waves were conducted, and measurement invariance tested. From our analyses, we can conclude that age and religiosity, alongside other sociodemographic variables, are important explanatory factors in the justification of life and death issues in all the countries examined; however, value orientations show less conclusive effects on such attitudes.","life and death issues, euthanasia, abortion, in-vitro fertilisation, values",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.07295462863130242,0,0,0.08374798562594847,0,0,0.06502174203676456,0,0,0,0,0.11400003236708071,10.312104,7.023423

In looking at the convergence of the biopolitics and necropolitics of disability, race, class, gender, and sexuality, I suggest Bolen's death and the 'last dance' that launched an international public conversation about it function as a celebration of slow death facilitated, in part, by dominant views of pain and disability.","disability, pain, biopolitics, slow death, right-to-die",czech,Space & Time,space - rural - place - places - material - critical - urban - city - everyday - geography,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0.32981363093713095,0.05821995638828063,0,0.14986514896973016,0.0597750277929371,0,0,0,8.166248,3.6379938

The analysis is based on theories of the individual life-course transition and social status theories. The empirical data were gathered from a representative survey conducted in Bulgaria in 2014 that focused on young people aged 15-34 who had left education within the previous five years. The results show that young people from large families with many siblings more often have emigration intentions and that previous emigration experience is the strongest predictor of emigration intentions. Emigration intensions are also more likely among people who have emigrated and later returned and ended up economically inactive.

A multi-level analysis performed on the 2010 European Social Survey dataset reveals that substantial differences exist between the two sides of the continent. While sociotropic measures show a uniformly strong, positive association with institutional trust, the marginal effect of relative income is positive in Western but negative in East-Central Europe. Moreover, although social inequality is inversely related to institutional trust, four ECE countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia), where relatively low inequality is accompanied by low levels of institutional trust, deviate from the general trend.

The analysis is based on short narratives written by secondary school students about their experiences with school (under-)achievement. The wider social context is clarified based on some research and statistical data. The analysis leads to the conclusion that striving for school success is a response to the neoliberal process of individualising responsibility, which is also reflected in 'truths' about the importance of early child care for later academic achievement-these 'truths' can be understood as normalising discourses, which have an important influence on the construction of the self and the parent-child relationship.","school achievement, Foucault, neoliberalism, discourse analysis, sociology of education, Slovenia",english,Education,educational - education - students - school - higher - secondary - values - socioeconomic - status - socioeconomic status,FALSE,0,0.24342426766576453,0,0,0.06322099714011871,0,0,0.06177098731633251,0,0,0,0,0.06204019419988828,10.63542,7.977789
