It explores the ‘marriage premium’, which refers to the advantage that children born to married parents have in comparison to other parental arrangements, and also highlights change in the ‘marriage premium’ after 1989. The analysis also examines the effect of marriage timing: Does the marriage premium differ between pre-birth and post-birth marriages? Did the effect of timing also change after 1989? The analysis is based on Czech GGS (Generations and Gender Survey) data from 2005. Direct marriages are the most stable unions, cohabitations are the least stable. Among couples who were not married, the odds of dissolution increased by 142 per cent (in comparison to marriages without pre-marital cohabitation). This ‘marriage premium’ increased after 1989. Marriage timing has come to play an increasingly important role. In the pre-1989 marriage cohort, pre-birth and post-birth marriage had the same stabilising effect. After 1989, however, pre-delivery wedding stabilises unions more than post-delivery legitimising marriages. We conclude that the era of highly individualised partnership choices has clearly shone a light on the consequences of these choices for subsequent union stability.","Klíčová slova: marriage, cohabitation, coresident partnership, union instability"

Using linked employer–employee data, the article answers the question of whether men and women were paid an equal wage for equal work in 2005–2020 and what part of the total GPG is caused by the segregation of women and men into different occupations, workplaces, and jobs. We also pose these questions separately for the public and private spheres, for selected industries, and for workplaces according to size. Throughout the monitored period, the GPG for equal work is around 10% and another roughly one-half of total GPG is caused by gender segregation. There has been a slight decrease since 2018, especially in workplaces with more than 5000 employees, where, however, the significance of women’s segregation into lower-paid positions is growing. The research confirmed that in more regulated, and therefore more transparent, contexts, such as the public sphere and in large workplaces (but also in small companies with up to 50 employees), the GPG for equal work is smaller than elsewhere. The results point to the need to systematically monitor the GPG and increase the transparency of remuneration systems in the workplace. In connection with the GPG, it will also be necessary to analyse the organisational processes that lead to women’s segregation into occupations, workplaces, and jobs that have lower wages, as well as the growing precarity of the Czech labour market.","Klíčová slova: gender wage gap, equal wage for equal work, gender segregation, wage transparency, linked employer–employee data"

It seeks to identify the factors that increase the chance that inhabitants of socially excluded localities (SELs) in Czechia will live in a hostel (a single room occupancy hotel). Do these factors indicate a higher intensity of social exclusion among people who live in hostels? Do hostels house the more disadvantaged segment of the disadvantaged population, such as the inhabitants of SELs? Our aim is to produce a more nuanced understanding of the different needs of the heterogeneous population of socially excluded localities, which can be used to implement socially inclusive measures. We analyse data obtained in a survey of the population of SELs. We apply binary logistic regression using socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of respondents and their households and variables measuring victimisation and respondents’ risk behaviour as predictors. Along with descriptive statistics we present the results of the simple and multiple binary logistic regressions. The multiple model revealed the following predictors to be statistically significant: the share of rent in household income, household size, residential mobility, citizenship, labour status, criminal activity not punished by imprisonment, nationality/ethnicity, and property victimisation of the household. Except for the last two, these factors increase the chance of socially disadvantaged persons living in a hostel. Future research directions and the political implications of our findings are discussed in the conclusion.","Klíčová slova: social exclusion, housing tenure, hostel, single-room occupancy hotels, residential segregation, urban marginality"

The subject has been explored mainly in the Western liberal and gay-family-friendly legislation and social environment so far. Our study was conducted in the Czech Republic, a CEE country where sexual minorities face strong legal and social barriers to non-heterosexual parenthood. In an online survey (N = 882) conducted in 2019 among self-identified gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual people with same-sex attraction, we found a considerable gap in parenting desires by sexual identity. Parenting desires are weaker among homosexuals, especially men, while bisexuals are closer to heterosexuals in their parenting desires. Our research suggests that in the context of discussions of parenthood Czech women are unwilling to identify as lesbians and opt instead to claim a different sexual identity. Our findings indicate that the structural barriers to parenthood thus play a much more important role than the overall liberal-minded atmosphere in the Czech Republic.","Klíčová slova: parenting desires, sexual identities, LGB individuals, Czech Republic/Czechia, CEE country, survey methodology"

United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Beirut","Social networks and collective trust have been studied in relation to civil uprisings such as the Arab Spring events of 2011. Social capital is also an important factor in the Middle East and North African (MENA) labour markets, where 'wasta' family connections are said to affect workers' opportunities. Little is known, however, about MENA citizens' social capital and its composition and distribution across socio-economic groups. As an advanced foundation on which to build future analyses, we propose a stochastic approach for measuring people's social capital using Bayesian clustering, based on three dimensions: level of social activity, quality of social networks, and trust. Applying the method to the 2000-2014 World Values Surveys for 16 MENA countries, we describe the composition and distribution of workers' social capital within and between countries, and estimate ordered-probability regressions of workers' employment outcomes as a function of the dimensions of social capital, workers' demographics, and subjective health assessment. We find that, among the three dimensions of social capital, social trust is most clearly conducive to the employment and full-time status of both genders. The level of social activity is associated with more autonomous, intellectual and creative occupations among men, but only with more creative occupations among women. Higher-quality social networks are associated with more autonomous jobs, but also less creative ones. Interestingly, trust is associated with non-autonomous, manual, and routine jobs. In creative jobs favoured by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, workers are selected from those with higher socializing levels but inhibited networks and trust.","Klíčová slova: employment vulnerability, Middle East and North Africa, social capital, World Values Surveys"

A holdout cross-validation method was used to evaluate the dimensionality of the institutional trust construct. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a six-factor solution, and the confirmatory factor analysis showed a good overall fit for the five-factor solution that included the following dimensions: political institutions, foreign institutions, social services institutions, order institutions, and media institutions. All five dimensions showed weak-to-moderate relationships with interpersonal trust measures. The present study highlights that delving into the dimensionality of institutional trust may contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon within specific geographical, political, societal, and historical, characteristics of the countries.","Klíčová slova: institutional trust, political trust, media trust, factor analysis"

Hejzlarová","Fakulta sociálních věd UK, Praha","Czechia had one of the longest school lockdowns during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Teachers with small children consequently faced a number of emotional dilemmas that primarily stemmed from the conflict between their role as a teacher and their role as a parent, which unfolded in the home as the one and only space in which to perform work, family care, and self-care. The paper is organised around the question of why teachers in this difficult situation did not take advantage of child sick leave, a public policy measure that could have helped them to reduce this conflict and to care for their children and their own mental health. In this study we draw on research into the emotional dimensions of public policies, micropolicies and micropolitics, and the self-conception of teachers. The analysis is based on a data sample of public policy documents, interviews with nine teachers, and discussion threads in a public Facebook group dedicated to teachers. We found that the main reasons teachers did not take child sick leave were their emotionally strongly sense of the imperatives attached to their self-conception as a teacher and supported by the micropolitics of schools, and their perception of child sick leave as representing uncertainty and failure rather than relief. Child sick leave has moreover been recognised as a public policy measure that is anchored in the modern separation of the public (work) and the private (family, care) spheres, which in the conditions of the pandemic crisis revealed its limitations.","Klíčová slova: care, teachers, emotions, micropolicies, micropolitics, self-concept, pandemic, child sick leave"

In the field of education, this involved closing schools and the continuation of education at home. In the Czech Republic, schools first closed in March 2021; the school closures lasted, with a few interruptions, for more than a year. Some educational functions that were traditionally performed by schools were temporarily transferred to parents of school-age children. This fact was a challenge for both schools and families and led to a temporary change in the distribution of educational responsibilities between the school and the family. From March to September 2021, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with the parents of children in primary schools who participated in their children's education during the school closures. The data were analysed by means of a thematic analysis. The aim of the study was to shed light on the nature of parents' educational involvement, describe new pedagogical aspects of parenthood that were not a part of it before the mass introduction of remote learning, and understand the reconfiguration of the relationship between school and family. The analysis of the data showed that the transfer of some educational responsibilities onto the shoulders of parents led to a quantitative and qualitative expansion of 'pedagogical' interventions in society, the (auto) didacticisation of parental identities, and a strengthening of parents' ability to engage in pedagogical reflexivity.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, school closures, remote learning, family, COVID-19"

Domestic violence, especially in the form of intimate partner violence against women, was expected to grow in intensity as a result of the social crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government of the Czech Republic did not introduce any special measures to address this during any of the lockdowns or as part of any counter-pandemic measures. To interpret the analysis, we deploy a conceptualisation of ignorance. Ignorance in the area of domestic violence is reflected in the inconsistency of the system of assistance, and this was observed during the pandemic as well. Ignorance is shown to be integral to the system of assistance to domestic violence survivors and a key factor in its efficiency. The article also brings concrete insights into the effects of ignorance, which could be used as a basis for introducing practical changes to the system of assistance to survivors of domestic violence.","Klíčová slova: violence against women, gender-based violence, forms of ignorance, system of assistance"

Whatever the verdict, it is a fact that the clients of residential social services were subject to stricter and longer lockdown measures than the rest of the population. Our ethnographic research describes the lockdown technologies used at Home F, a residential institution for people identified as disabled. Setting out from the assumption that freedom is not the antithesis of some united regulatory regime but is the result of the intersection of various repertoires and logics of influence, the research analyses the 'passages' that regulate relations between the clients and their surroundings before and during the pandemic. It shows that the regulatory mechanisms that were put in place to facilitate an effective pandemic response do not constitute a new apparatus but only an intensification of technologies already in place. With the aim of mitigating risk, they delegitimise the needs of clients, render relations dependent on obedience, and pass moralised judgements on behaviour. Such 'pedagogical arrangements' cause emotional suffering and do not leave much space for freedom. In the discussion in the article we link our findings to the current debates about the productivity of power and (post)critical pedagogy, concluding that while pedagogy necessarily accompanies the management of risks, a critical gesture that delegitimises the interests and opinions of the objects of pedagogy may not be the most appropriate pedagogical method available.","Klíčová slova: residential institutions, COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, risk management, building maintenance, pedagogical relations, post-critical pedagogy"

It is predicted that working from home will continue to be a common form of work after the crisis. In this article, we investigate whether and how working frequently from home during the pandemic was associated with work-family conflict and how the strength of the association varied between different groups of people depending on gender, education, employment, and the presence of children in the household. We also examine what connection existed between role conflicts and the quality of a partnership. To answer these questions we analysed data from the 'Czech GGS Covid Pilot Study' from December 2020 and found that working frequently from home was associated with more frequent work-family conflict. Respondents experienced more problems performing their family role (e.g. they were too tired to do housework) than their role as an employee. As the intensity of work from home increased, however, respondents tended to report more frequent problems performing their role as an employee (e.g. family responsibilities made it difficult for them to concentrate on work). The association between working from home and work-family conflict differed significantly depending on the gender and the presence of children in the household. For men and parents of children under the age of 15, working from home was more significantly associated with work-family conflict. People who often experienced work-family conflict also more often considered breaking up with their partner. Working from home thus became a significant stressor for family life during the pandemics.","Klíčová slova: working from home, Covid-19, Generations and Gender Survey, work-family conflict, partnership quality"

We present an analysis of serial qualitative interviews with 32 solo mothers and 19 parents living in couples that were conducted between the spring of 2020 and the summer of 2021. Parents had a both positive and negative experience of care during the Covid-19 pandemic. The first school closure in the spring of 2020 was perceived as a rather positive opportunity to step outside the course of everyday life. However, as the pandemic continued, the long-term negative effects that the increased care duties during lockdown had on people and especially mothers became apparent: a worsening labour market position, a deteriorating economic situation, and an increasing dependence of women on male breadwinners or on the social support system. The pandemic highlighted the paradox of reproductive work in late capitalism and showed how childcare has no market value in itself. Although in the first period of the pandemic parents experienced care to some extent as an opportunity, a source of meaning, and a rediscovered value, overall the pandemic did not lead to a greater recognition or valuation of care in society.","Klíčová slova: care, pandemic Covid-19, risk, gender, parenting"

Based on a qualitative analysis of interviews with parents of children under 12, we examine the processes that led to the increase or dismantling of the gender division of labour in families during the first nationwide lockdown. Using the concepts of path dependency and 'doing' and 'undoing' gender, we explain the strategies couples with children used to adapt to the enormous increase in reproductive work in the family during lockdown. 'Doing gender' practices witnessed during lockdown included an acceptance of the increased care work as the responsibility of women, ensuring 'a room of one's own' only for men, and separating the public and private sphere only for men. Practices that led to 'undoing gender' involved mainly the explicit negotiation between partners of the division of labour during the lockdown and the organisation of reproductive work in 'shifts'. The division of labour within a couple before the pandemic proved to be crucial for what strategy they chose to adapt to the lockdown. According to our findings, extending the egalitarian division of labour has led to greater satisfaction among partners and indicates greater societal resilience to crises.","Klíčová slova: pandemic, Covid-19, division of labour, doing gender, undoing gender"

An interest in research with practical applications began to prevail. This article explains how this transformation came about in France and what contributed to the change. Sociologists at the Sorbonne were the first to actively support the use of an empirical approach in the social sciences. In this connection they invited Paul Lazarsfeld, one of the founders of the Columbia school of sociology, to spend a year at the Sorbonne in 1962. Drawing on archive sources, this article reveals the factors that lay behind the creation of an original three-volume anthology of methodological writings that was the outcome of collaboration between Lazarsfeld and Raymond Boudon. They compiled this anthology in French with the aim of promoting this new research paradigm among social scientists in France. The article examines the structure of this French methodology textbook, analyses the thematic orientation of the articles, and notes different works that were jointly authored by French and American scholars. On a second sabbatical at the Sorbonne in 1967, Lazarsfeld followed up on this publishing activity and further pursued his primary interest - the methodology of data analysis.","Klíčová slova: France, Paul Lazarsfeld, Raymond Boudon, Sorbonne, methodology of empirical social research"

It uses binary logistic regression to identify the variables that predict the economic inactivity of men and women at the age of 60 plus and the interactions of variables to examine whether the factors that determine when people exit the labour market are the same for men and women. The analysis uses data from the Labour Force Study (LFS) collected in the fourth quarter of 2017 and focuses on people between the ages of 60 and 69 and five independent variables: gender, education, pension eligibility, marital status, and type of job. It studies how gender intersects with other characteristics in the decision to retire from the labour market. Although pension eligibility is the central predictor of economic inactivity after the age of 60, when eligibility is controlled for here, it is evident that gender, education, job type, and marital status all influence the timing of labour market exits. Women leave work earlier than men, and this is found to be true even when we control for their education or pension eligibility. They are also more likely than men to leave work even if they are not yet eligible to collect a pension. The effect of education is not as straightforward for women as for men: women with the lowest and with the highest levels of education are more likely to continue to work than men with the same educational attainment. Policies to prolong people's working lives may thus have a different impact on each gender.","Klíčová slova: retirement, pension, gender, ageing, extended working lives"

Based on a study conducted among Czech hospital chaplains affiliated with the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren, the Roman Catholic Church, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church, and the Church of Seventh Day Adventists, the article examines the experiences of Christian providers of spiritual care in the secularised environment of a hospital and sheds light on how they perceive their work and role. Two waves of interviews were conducted among thirteen hospital chaplains, male and female, and subjected to an applied thematic analysis. This produced four thematic areas that the article explores in detail: (1) the localisation of the chaplaincy within the hospital, (2) the chaplains' methods of working with patients, (3) the chaplains' relationships with other hospital personnel, and (4) the self-identification of the hospital chaplains. The results of this research revealed that the secularised environment of the Czech Republic is a crucial factor that affects the work of chaplains in several ways, but their role in the hospital has at the same time developed in ways that are separate from their religious affiliation, as the understanding dialogue they engage in with patients forms a core part of their work.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, hospital chaplains, secularised institution, chaplaincy"

The 2015 referendum represents a tipping point in the formation of a new Slovak conservative political front. In this article, meaning-making among actors civically engaged in the referendum is brought to light by re-constructing the deep cultural structures in which they are immersed. Drawing upon the strong programme in cultural sociology, I analyse the master narratives woven through the discourse of the referendum organisers and boycotters. These narratives are re-constructed from 20 semi-structured interviews with the engaged actors and a corpus of 82 written documents, such as blogs, speeches, and declarations concerning the referendum. The analysis employs the methods of thick description and the structural analysis of narrative genres. It shows that, first, the referendum controversy presents a clash between a narrative of social decline and a narrative of social progress. The narratives serve as moral regulators by deploying emotionally loaded images of nostalgia for 'traditional families' and a utopia of unconditional progress. Second, although both narratives interpret the referendum as a milestone in the history of Slovakia, they do so in different genres with specific implications for action. Using the example of the decision by referendum opponents to withdraw from the pre-referendum debates, I demonstrate how narrative genres as implicit and deep cultural structures have the power to orient action and shape the contours of controversy.","Klíčová slova: narrative, genre, culture, meaning-making, referendum"

This phenomenon, known as the 'rally-'round-the-flag' effect, has also been observed as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic in many countries. Citizens' trust in the government's good intentions and ability to handle a crisis is very important, as it gives government the legitimacy to take strong measures. High trust in government also increases citizens' willingness to comply with these measures. The aim of this study is to examine the 'rally-'round-the-flag' effect in the Czech Republic, analyse the characteristics related to the increase in trust in government, and test the relationship between trust in government and compliance with anti-pandemic measures. The analysis uses data from five waves of the Czech Household Panel Study (2016–2020) and finds a dramatic increase in trust in government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A relatively higher increase in trust in government was observed among people with a low level of education and low social trust. Overall, however, the rise in trust in government is more of a general tendency across society than it is an increase in one specific group of the population. Trust in government is also linked to compliance with anti-pandemic measures.","Klíčová slova: Covid-19, trust in government, health, 'rally-'round-the-flag' effect"

Drawing on a wealth of empirical material, including media outputs, court proceedings, changes in legislation, expert opinions, and other supplementary materials, the article examines the homebirth dispute on the legislative, judicial, and public policy levels and in relation to the media and experts. The analysis structures the evolution of the dispute into five phases that reflect the evolution of the homebirth issue from the perspective of civil sphere dynamics. One of the key moments in the societalisation process 'code-switching'. In the Czech homebirth context, code-switching occurs when homebirth ceases to be presented in the media solely as a health-care problem, articulated dominantly by doctors as the experts in this field, and it becomes a dispute over human rights and the right to choose as central values of a liberal-democratic political establishment. The concept of societalisation can be used to present a coherent story of the homebirth dispute while maintaining the complexity of the issue and highlighting the civil sphere's important activating role.","Klíčová slova: homebirth, societalisation, health care, civil sphere, democracy"

The theoretical framework used to grasp the anti-corruption positions expressed in the manifestos is populism. The study builds on the discussions about mainstream political actors (not) adopting populist principles and on the methodological debate around the possibilities offered by populist communication research. Using a content analysis and the principle of triplets, the article analyses the election manifestos of all the parties that were successful in the parliamentary elections between 1990 and 2017 in order to determine whether there was a stronger presence of populist principles in communication on the topic of corruption. Among other things, the study shows that: (1) statements on corruption that are consistent with a populist communication strategy can be found in parties that are not commonly understood as populist throughout the entire researched period; (2) mainstream parties did not respond to the success of populists in the 2010, 2013, and 2017 elections by adopting populist principles; (3) the populists who won a share of power strengthened the elements of populist communication in the next election manifesto.","Klíčová slova: populism, corruption, anti-corruption, measuring populism, populist communication, Czech politics, party manifestos"

A central experience of migrant children is that they grow up and are involved in both the emigration and immigration country (of their parents). Many of them circulate between Germany and Turkey several times and maintain multiple relationships across national borders when they are growing up. This has implications for their family relationships and educational careers in childhood, but beyond that it also has effects that are detectable into adulthood. The article shows that migrant children develop the potential and skills that enable them to live a transnational life. The question the article therefore addresses is whether and how a transnational childhood affects the transnationality and integration of the next generation in the adult life.","Klíčová slova: transnationality, integration, migrant children, next generation, socialisation"

Its main focus is the self-identification of young Ukrainians studying in the Czech Republic. The authors explore and describe international students' different integration and transnational dispositions and also discuss whether these dispositions could be seen as part of antagonistic or synergetic processes. The interconnection between transnationalism and integration is widely discussed in both sociological and anthropological literature, and most scholars identify them as synergetic processes. In the case of Ukrainian students in the Czech Republic, however, the authors argue that these processes can be understood as both synergetic and antagonistic because what matters is the students' self-identification. Most of the analysis presented in this article is based on in-depth interviews with Ukrainian students conducted between 2012 and 2019. The results of qualitative research are also compared to and discussed in relation to the findings from an on-line survey conducted among 258 Ukrainian students in 2018. The article suggests that Ukrainian students themselves could incline in both directions, towards an antagonistic and a synergetic understanding of integration and transnationalism, because it depends on their self-expressed dispositions.

This article examines the link between transnationalism and integration processes among return migrants from the Armenian diaspora and examines the role social networks play in integration in Armenia. Returnees to Armenia can be divided into those who have returned from the Armenian diaspora (second and subsequent generations of migrants) and those who emigrated from Armenia and decided to return. This is reflected in the literature as a distinction between the 'old' and the 'new' Armenian diaspora, the latter having emerged in the 1990s. Before returning, both groups maintained ties with people in Armenia and may differ only by the extent and frequency of use of these ties. These ties can then accompany them when they return to Armenia and help them to (re-)integrate. The integration of returnees has its own specifics, compared to the integration of migrants, and may not be as simple as it might seem. This article focuses on the transnational ties of 23 migrants of Armenian descent who returned to Armenia after a long time abroad and draws on original research on return migration in Armenia conducted in 2016 and 2018. Semi-structured interviews with returnees revealed that their participation in the labour market is instrumental to their integration into mainstream society, and their work may involve transnational activities. The article shows the different opportunities that weak and strong ties provide returnees and that may facilitate their integration. Weak ties on a local level are crucial for returnees to be able to reintegrate and fully participate in life in Armenia. The article aims to understand the return strategy as one of the migration options that may or may not be permanent. A return may be followed by re-migration, under certain conditions and if obstacles to sustainable reintegration, and the article also explores the motivations for re-migration.","Klíčová slova: return migration, transnationalism, diaspora, reintegration, Armenia"

This article examines this vague concept to shed light on how its evolution over time has shaped the current conceptions of migrant integration in the EU and the Czech Republic. It describes the situation in the Czech Republic and the country's normative goals in the field of migrant integration. While the country has explicit integration priorities in place, there is no evaluation of their fulfilment. The article explores whether these priorities are indeed fulfilled and from what sources by analysing a unique dataset of 3061 projects in the field of migrant integration. All these projects were implemented in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2019. The results show that although funding for migrant integration has increased since 2016, even taking into account the long-term increase in the number of migrants in the Czech Republic, funding in support of these priorities is allocated very unevenly. European funding remains crucial. Among the most supported priorities is knowledge of the Czech language and education. There is also some support in the social field. By contrast, the issues of discrimination, equal rights, foreign nationals' access to health care, and the development of professional skills receive hardly any support. The results thus show a discrepancy between the priorities that have been set and their fulfilment, especially in the area of activities targeting the majority society and its institutions. The declared two-sidedness to the process of integration process thus remains a somewhat unsupported vision.","Klíčová slova: integration, migration, governance, transnationalism, evaluation"

Three origin groups of immigrants were distinguished: non-European, post-communist, and West, Central, and South European countries. We estimated the size of the wealth gap between each immigrant population and natives, the sources of the gap, and the trajectory of wealth convergence. The data revealed that the mean net worth of native-born groups was higher than that of all immigrant sub-groups. The gap was widest for non-European immigrants and lowest for West, Central, and South European immigrants. Differences in the rate of homeownership accounted for the largest portion of the gap, while neither differential levels of income nor education accounted for much of the gap between native-born and either non-European immigrants or immigrants from post-communist countries. Reception of gifts or inheritances did not account for a meaningful portion of the gaps. Estimation of the rate of convergence suggests that it would take an average of 85 years after arrival for an average immigrant household to bridge the wealth gap between it and an average native-born household.

All three constructs showed independent effects on aspirations for higher education, controlling for vocational sector, gender, school achievement, and school year. Further, a moderation effect was identified, indicating that the association between cultural capital and aspirations for higher education was stronger among students with more educated parents. In contrast to previous studies, the findings point to the potential complementarity of cultural capital and RRA concerning educational aspirations. We discuss the implications of the study and directions for future research.","Klíčová slova: aspirations for higher education, cultural capital, relative risk aversion, socio-economic status, vocational education"

City, University of London","In the context of flourishing cross-national and multi-level research, the variety of macro and micro data sources available to researchers have evolved into an interdependent ecosystem of social indicators. Focusing on four comparative social surveys, this paper examines the extent to which secondary data users take advantage of a range of complementary data sources to broaden the breadth or strengthen the robustness of their research. Using two Google Scholar-based datasets of 2789 and 796 publications, we find that, despite the complex equivalence issues in comparative survey research, users combine data to a considerable extent, aiming to increase conceptual, geographic, and temporal coverage and cross-validate findings. Selecting the example of the European Social Survey, 183 journal articles are qualitatively examined to identify specific epistemic gains attained by analysts when combining ESS survey data with data from other comparative programmes. The strategy involves risks, emanating from either analysts' own misjudgements or arising from the wider issues of comparability and transparency in cross-national survey research. However, a number of data harmonisation platforms have recently emerged that may facilitate the standardisation of measures across surveys, augmenting the possibilities for future theory development and research.","Klíčová slova: comparative surveys, social indicators, academic users, data ecosystem, multi-level analysis"

The Degree of Incongruity between Employment Preferences and Their Actual Experiences (1994–2012),Livia García-Faroldi,University of Malaga,"This paper examines the congruity between mothers' preferences and actual experiences when raising preschool children, using data on mothers of reproductive ages (18–49) from the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) (1994, 2002, and 2012). The findings show that (i) with one exception, in all the countries and years, mothers whose preferences were congruent with their actual employment statuses outnumbered those whose preferences and employment statuses were incongruent; (ii) whereas Czech mothers improved their situations during the period (the congruity increases), Polish mothers - who began the period with the highest congruity - experienced a decrease in congruity, while Hungarian mothers showed the lowest congruity and saw a slight improvement in their situations (they achieved more congruity); and (iii) women who had their children during the communist regimes were more likely to experience incongruity because they worked more than they desired to, while women who became mothers during the post-communist period were more likely to experience congruity when they stayed at home, but they were also more likely to experience incongruity because they were inactive and considered working desirable. Therefore, the results confirm similar trends and diverging paths among the three countries. The high degree of incongruity between preferences and actual experiences is a sign of the problems faced by mothers attempting to reconcile work and family life and also impacts other phenomena, such as female employment, gender equality and fertility.","Klíčová slova: work-family conflict, gender roles, refamilialisation, fertility, post-communism"

Using survival analysis and Czech GGS data, it shows that the intergeneration transmission of divorce varied over marital cohorts to a significant degree. While parental divorce had insignificant effect in the oldest marriage cohort, it subsequently grew. In the 1980–1989 marriage cohort, the risk of divorce was 3.7 times higher among children of divorced parents than among children whose parents did not divorce. In the most recent marriage cohort (1990–2005), the parental divorce effect weakened but was still significant: children of divorced parents experienced a divorce risk that was twice as high that of children from intact families. This convergence of divorce risks resulted from two parallel trends: the rising divorce risk among children from non-divorced families and the declining divorce risk among children of divorce.","Klíčová slova: divorce, intergenerational transmission of divorce, population change, survival analysis"

Interdisciplinary studies of childhood perceive it as a social construct separable from biological immaturity, and they describe a distinct toddler style of socialisation with peers. In this paradigm, participation in cultural routines is central to understanding child socialisation. Based on ethnographic observations in two facilities and interviews with teachers and parents, we explore relationships between peers, social routines, and the creation of collectivity. We focus on the perspective of adults and their perception of the children's collective and on the meanings of children's interactions. The analyses reveal that as well as socialising in hierarchical relationships with adults they also actively participate in cultural reproduction through the interpretation of meanings. What constitutes 'play' when socialising with adults becomes 'something real' when it occurs between physical and cognitive equals. Interaction with peers in a day-care facility allows a child to experience a collective 'WE', through which they are then able to to control adults. However, the creation of collectivity depends on their being conditions in place that are suitable for small children and toddlers.","Klíčová slova: childhood, toddler, peer collectivity, play, socialisation"

Applying both a diachronic and a synchronic perspective, the author focuses on the mechanisms of the territorialisation of the Roma that led to the preservation of the historical continuity of the Romani settlement and to its territorial stigmatisation. He shows how local identification and position in the residential structure of the village studied here translated into a more enduring differentiation among Roma themselves. The author argues that crucial to understanding this process is the racialised category of 'Gypsyness', through which the Roma were singled out as 'less local'. 'Gypsyness' was also strongly associated with the space of the settlement and at the same time served as a generally accepted reason for its very existence. By setting up their own strategy of social mobility and striving to achieve full-fledged local belonging, the Roma, to a large extent, subscribed to the dominant logic of 'Gypsyness' and thus reproduced it, but they also transformed some of its characteristics, integrating it into their own understanding of their sociability in an environment of historically rooted non-Romani dominance.","Klíčová slova: Roma, eastern Slovakia, Gypsyness, local belonging, territorialisation, territorial stigmatisation, Romani settlements"

The findings presented in this paper are based on qualitative research conducted in Czech prisons. The data corpus includes qualitative interviews with selected actors in the prison world and an analysis of relevant documents relating to the research topic. Sociology and the prison system meet on two basic levels in the Czech Republic. As an external partnership that seems to have grown stronger over the years and as an internal bond that has weakened (and almost been dismissed) since the end of the 1990s.  Sociology has formally retained a place behind the bars of Czech prisons thanks to the sociologists who according to the regulations of the Czech prison service should figure among the prison staff. In reality, the initial enthusiasm for this practice faded over the years and there are no sociologists currently working in Czech prisons. In this paper the author presents some possible explanations for this, ofers a historical description of the (non)participation of sociologists in Czech prisons, and discusses the possibilities for the future development of Czech penitentiary sociology.","Klíčová slova: penitentiary sociology, prison, Czech Republic, inmates, social science"

As the term 'niche' suggests, the programmes of these parties tend to be focused on issues that are either overlooked or insufficiently addressed by other political parties. The rich contemporary theoretical discussion on niche parties has noted that they focus more on defending their programme than exercising political power. This assumption, however, has not been tested on empirical data on the real activity of niche parties in the political arena. The goal of this study is to fill this gap in knowledge and verify this theoretical assumption by conducting a statistical analysis of the activities of six niche parties in selected stages of the negotiation of various bills in the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic between 1996 and 2020. The analysis large confirmed the theoretical assumption we set out to test. However, the results of our analysis also reveal that there are noticeable differences in the activity of niche parties.

However, what settings are used can have major implications, primarily in the form of conceptual problems, where the exploratory version is often used instead of the confirmatory version. Other settings used can also have an impact on the results. These are mainly partial options, which are used mainly in the exploratory version, in particular the choice of the correct correlation coefficients, the choice of method for the initial extraction of factors, the choice of the rotation method and the choice of the number of factors with which we want to work in the exploratory version. The text discusses the algorithms for ordinal variables, and the possibility of determining the number of factors through parallel analysis or MAP. The practical example discusses the advantages of the oblique rotation of factors.

This article, based on a combination of qualitative sociological and historical research, questions this narrative and deems it a myth. The district’s proximity to a landfill and the consequent environmental effects of this played a decisive role in its ghettoisation, yet these factors have never been systematically analysed and discussed. Although Luník IX was not officially and originally designed as a ghetto, it became one as a result of structural, social, and environmental factors. Utilising the conceptual and theoretical framework of environmental justice, the article focuses on the spatial distribution of the adverse environmental effects in relation to social and ethnic factors. The case of Luník IX, with its roots in the period of a centrally planned economy, provides a unique opportunity to make a comparative study of the social processes from a historical perspective. It allows us to analyse the mechanism of decision-making in an avowedly non-capitalist society, where in reality we see many similarities in how income inequality between richer and poorer neighbourhoods, together with ethnic/racial factors, has shaped the city.","Klíčová slova: environmental justice, Roma ethnic minority, Luník IX, urban ghetto"

The study understands ageing as an embodied process and explores the meanings that are attached to the body in the narratives of older persons who have acquired impairment in later life and are receiving care. Because the onset of impairment and infirmity marks a point of transition, the study considers the bodily aspects of the ageing process as key elements, despite this being highly problematic in current social gerontology. The authors call for a complex approach to understanding the meanings of the body in the transitions into old age and drawing on their own study based on three repeated interviews with ten older adults conducted over the course of one year (8 women, mean age = 83.8 years), they explore the meanings that are attached to the body in the context of receiving care. Their analysis of the personal accounts and narratives of everyday activities from the participants in their study revealed that embodiment in action is the main topic through which participants experienced their everydayness. The meanings of embodiment in action are shaped and reconstructed on three dimensions that capture important processes of embodiment in action: the sensing of the body (the Body as an Organiser of Activities), anticipation of the body (the Body as an Uncertain Companion), and the managing of the body (the Body as Work to Be Done). The findings offer insights into the processes of transitions in old age, in which the emotional, social, and behavioural aspects of embodiment in action, rather than age, play the key role. The study further highlights that the meanings of the body are complex, highly relevant, and should not be overlooked within the organisational practice of social and health care.","Klíčová slova: fourth age, body, transitions, acquired impairment, repeated interviews, meaning of the body"

The aim of this study is to test the instrument's measurement invariance between 2009 and 2019 and determine whether - despite the modifications made to the instrument over the years - the results remain comparable. Data from eight representative surveys of the economically active population in the Czech Republic were analysed (total N = 6909) using the MG CFA method (configural, metric, and scalar invariance) and the alignment method (approximate measurement invariance). The findings from the MG CFA tests for measurement invariance indicate that the SQWLi instrument achieves configural and metric invariance over time but not full scalar invariance. Achieving a partial scalar invariance would be challenging because of the many high modification indices; therefore, an approximate measurement invariance approach, namely the Alignment Method, was applied. The results suggest that comparisons of latent means across all years can be made. Consequently, it is possible to make meaningful comparisons of overall indices of dimensions (batteries) and of more general domains. However, not all the individual items can be compared. The results confirm that the biggest risk of invariance is caused by conceptual changes to items and by substantial or frequent modifications to item wording. Conversely, the results also show that a conceptual change to an entire dimension may not necessarily cause any problem on the general level, and that a disruption of invariance caused by changes to the range of scales used can be rectified by means of their harmonisation ex post.","Klíčová slova: SQWLi, subjective quality of working life, exact and approximate measurement invariance, alignment method"

Chronological age is a significant factor that influences both the experience of risk and the impact of the pandemic in daily life. This articles discusses how chronological age and the category of 'older people' were addressed in social and health policies and the discourses surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19. It examines how these processes can affect the position of older people in society and the relationships between different generations. The article focuses on four main arguments. First, it points out that chronological age was established as a significant vector defining the human position in society during the pandemic. Second, it argues that the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to accelerate age-divisions in our societies and may contribute to the growth of ageist representations. Third, the way age was mobilised and depicted in debates surrounding the pandemic situation has also had an impact on intergenerational solidarity and may reinforce antagonism between generations. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed some key structural problems in the field of elderly care and paternalistic attitudes that persist in relation to older people. The second part of the article discusses possible challenges relating to ageism, the well-being of older people, and elderly care that need to be addressed by (social) gerontology and the social sciences and that have been further exacerbated (not only) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Klíčová slova: age division, ageism, care, chronological age, COVID-19, intergenerational solidarity"

In this article I examine how the social participation of older adults is impacted by their different partnership histories. I am particularly interested in whether there are any differences in the social participation (activities involving contact with family, friends, acquaintances, children, grandchildren) of people who experienced divorce in life (I use a decomposition of the divorce rate to distinguish between those who had this experience when they were relatively young, middle-aged, or older). The data source for this analysis is the panel survey 'Dynamics of Change in Czech Society' and especially one unique component of the survey, which are the diaries on how people spend their time. Out of the total sample of respondents who maintained daily diary entries, I analyse the responses of those over the age of 60. The hypotheses that a lower level of social participation would be observed among people who had experienced divorced and that divorcing later in life would have a stronger negative effect on social participation are not confirmed by the data. The level of social participation measured using time-use diaries is found to be comparable across different partnership histories and irrespective of when in life a person gets divorced. In the conclusion of the article, I discuss these findings in a criticism of the overly negative paradigm that governs research on divorce in the social sciences.","Klíčová slova: social participation, old age, divorce, partnership trajectory/history, consequences of divorce"

Gerontosociology notes the elderly's preferential focus on the family, which is usually defined in terms of intergenerational relationships and a support network in old age. Relationships with siblings lie outside the research interest of gerontosociology because they are considered peer relationships, which is to say that they, too, are subject to the effects of ageing and old age and, consequently, are less reliable as a source of help or care. However, the article shows that the elderly assign meaning to their relationships with their siblings, which go beyond mere instrumental assistance and which challenges the generally accepted view that sibling bonds are of secondary importance compared to relationships between older parents and adult children. The article answers the question of what the essence of siblinghood in old age is, its possible forms, and in what ways (according to what rules) the elderly maintain or develop sibling relationships - how they communicate in interactions with each other and in interactions with other members of their family of procreation and their shared family of origin. The article is based on the results of an analysis of data from a qualitative study carried out by conducting unstructured individual and group interviews as part of the project 'Greying Siblinghood: Sociological Study of Siblinghood in Late Adulthood'. In the theoretical framework of interpretive sociology, in which the article is anchored, both the key concepts of the relationist approach (family configuration, relatedness, belongingness, practices and rules of kinship interaction) and the concept of kinship ambivalence come to the forefront.","Klíčová slova: siblinghood, sibling/family relationships, making siblinghood/family – practices, rules, old age"

It is based on an analysis of data collected in Czechia in 2017-2019 from 91 qualitative interviews and three focus groups with participants aged 50+. The concept of social roles used here considers a plurality of role repertoires, which actors can choose from, combine, and variously emphasise. Focusing on the social roles of the sibling and the sibling-in-law shows how each of these roles is specific. Both of these roles have a repertoire of targeted support for sibling/ kin cohesiveness and a repertoire of common solidarity and sociability. The sibling's role also includes repertoires of intimate closeness and emergency assistance. Both roles can be performed as a minimalist repertoire. The repertoire of the sibling-in-law role is defined in relation to the role of the sibling/the life partner; the minimum expectation of a sibling is to not avoid contact with others and to show an interest in his/her sibling. Both roles are based on mutual autonomy and at the same time a willingness to maintain the sibling / kin relationship. How the two roles interfere and interact with each other is clear and provides insight into other dimensions of both roles. While it is possible to remain with the minimalist repertoire, it can generally be said that the role of a sibling and the role of a sibling-in-law acquire increasing importance as people grow older.","Klíčová slova: sibling, sibling-in-law, social role, role repertoire"

Municipal representatives can perform their office either full time (an 'engaged' representative) or part time (a 'disengaged' representative). It is common in some small Czech municipalities for there to be no full-time representatives, and even mayors are disengaged. There is no central database or website in Czech Republic that contains a list of all the municipalities and disengaged representatives and it was thus very difficult to obtain the necessary data. However, the authors discovered an original method for determining whether representatives are (dis)engaged and created a unique dataset of almost 6000 Czech municipalities. They used a specific item in the expenditures of every municipality's budget that concerns compulsory social insurance payments and they sorted municipalities according to whether their representatives worked full time or part time before the 2018 Czech municipal elections. They used ordinary least square regression models to reach conclusions. The results revealed that the presence of full-time representatives before the municipal elections increased the number of candidates per seat. Therefore, the authors found that there is greater electoral competitiveness in municipalities with full-time representatives who have higher salaries.","Klíčová slova: remuneration, electoral competition, local politics, elections, mayors"

The aim of this article is to find out if there is an association between coresidence with grandparents and an adolescent's academic performance, and if there is to discover whether the association is different for two-parent and one-parent families and whether it can be explained by the families' socioeconomic status. Data from PISA 2012 are used to investigate the association with mathematics, reading, and science literacy test scores as an indicator of school achievement. The results of the analysis revealed a weak positive association between coresidence with grandparents and adolescents' academic performance. The association becomes statistically significant when controlling for socioeconomic status and is not significantly different in two-parent and one-parent families. The results suggest that there is a positive association between three-generational coresidence and 15-year-old students' academic performance, but it is partially suppressed by the families' socioeconomic status.","Klíčová slova: three-generational coresidence, coresidence with grandparents, PISA, academic performance, literacy"

The conclusion shows a significant shift from a non-work-oriented to a work-oriented motivation for participating in NFE and fluctuations between intrinsic to extrinsic motivations.

Conditions of economic and social security positively contributed to this shift especially in high-income countries. In this paper, we study the modernisation change on value structures in selected Central and Eastern European countries and compare them with Western European ones and look at the generational differences. We first check whether the value shift is moving in the assumed direction and whether it is copying trends observed in Western European countries. We then look at different generations to determine whether the younger generations in CEE countries that grew up after 1989, in a time of rapid economic and political change, show higher levels of post-materialist and post-modern values than the generations socialised and raised during the communist regime. We use data collected by the international repeated cross-sectional European Values Study (EVS). The results are not clear-cut on whether socioeconomic modernisation has led to higher shares of post-materialism, more gender-egalitarian attitudes, and stronger support for individual-choice norms in CEE countries. In all the spheres of cultural modernisation analysed we found differences in values and attitudes between generations: the older generations were always more traditional than the younger generations. This was not just true in the CEE countries, as the same trend was recorded in the Western European countries.","Klíčová slova: value modernisation, individual-choice norms, pro-family norms, gender equality"

The study uses data from three pooled waves of the European Values Study (EVS) covering the period 1999–2017 to which it applies the linear decomposition technique and multivariate statistical analysis. The results show that, even though the work ethic decreased in the Czech Republic and increased in Slovakia, intergenerational population replacement contributed to its weakening in both countries. Furthermore, the results indicate that the reason this process dominated the overall trend in the Czech Republic but not that in Slovakia may be the historical differences in levels of socioeconomic development and the different paces of population replacement. Finally, tentative evidence in favour of modernisation theory is presented, indicating that population replacement universally contributed to a decrease in the work ethic in all the other European countries with comparable EVS data.","Klíčová slova: work ethic, work orientations, modernisation theory, linear decomposition, European Values Study."

Using data from the European Values Study on 28 countries with the time frame between 1990 and 2008, the analysis shows that the previously observed link between higher education and post-materialism also applies to work values. Higher-educated Europeans were both more post-materialistic and less materialistic in their work orientations than their lower-educated counterparts. This association was, however, weakened by tertiary expansion. Work-related post-materialism declined with the increasing share of university-educated individuals in the working-age population. Interestingly, so, too, did work-related materialism, yet only until the expansion reached 25%, then it gradually increased. It is suggested that these developments, at least in part, stem from the changing position of higher-educated workers in the labour market.","Klíčová slova: tertiary expansion, Bologna process, massification, post-materialism, European Values Study"

Understood in evaluative terms, political trust has often been linked to the performance of the state and its institutions. The macrolevel sources of trust, however, are not well understood owing to the scarcity of empirical tests beyond cross-sectional analyses. This paper examines economic performance and the quality of governance as determinants of political trust in Europe. The analysis relies on data from the European Values Study and the World Values Survey between 1990 and 2019, covering 42 European countries surveyed at least twice. The modelling strategy explicitly distinguishes between-country variation from within-country variation in macrolevel characteristics, enabling the examination of cross-national and longitudinal effects. The results provide evidence of associations between economic performance – economic development and unemployment – and political trust in the expected directions, with some differences across European regions. Further, countries with less corruption tend to enjoy higher political trust, but the effects of changes in the level of corruption on trust depend on the corruption indicator used. Finally, improvements in the quality of electoral democracy are associated with declines in political trust.","Klíčová slova: political trust, public opinion, institutional performance, economic development, unemployment, democracy, corruption, cross-national research"

To do this, we first tracked variations across two points in time, and then looked at the effects of value orientations and socio-demographic factors in comparative perspective across countries. Based on previous literature, we consider justification for euthanasia, abortion, and in vitro fertilisation as a latent variable using European Value Study data from the 2008 and 2017 waves. Five European societies were analysed: Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Russia. All the countries observed showed growing levels of justification for these practices, although significant differences were found in the value orientation effects and respondents´ background variables on attitudes towards life and death issues. In order to properly address comparability, multi-group confirmatory factor analyses across countries and across waves were conducted, and measurement invariance tested. From our analyses, we can conclude that age and religiosity, alongside other sociodemographic variables, are important explanatory factors in the justification of life and death issues in all the countries examined; however, value orientations show less conclusive effects on such attitudes.","Klíčová slova: life and death issues, euthanasia, abortion, in-vitro fertilisation, values"

Taking advantage of the large-scale, comparative, and long-run measurement of value orientations in the European Values Study 1981–2017 it focuses on value change connected with divorce in a macro perspective. The article explores the acceptance of divorce in three aspects: 1) it measures and compares the trends in the acceptance of divorce in various European societies between 1981(1991) and 2017 and contrasts these trends with the data on divorce rates in these countries; (2) it explores the consistency/correlation between divorce attitudes and the affinitive value orientations associated in the broader set of values connected with the concept of the deinstitutionalisation of marriage; (3) it looks for the correlates of divorce acceptance and the changes in acceptance over time at the individual level (sex, education, cohort, family background, religiosity). Because of the descriptive nature of the research, no hypotheses are tested. The results show that divorce acceptance is rising over time in all EVS countries, and the acceptance is connected to divorce levels in given societies. Attitudes towards divorce form a consistent set of values together with other marriage deinstitutionalisation indicators. The acceptance of divorce correlates on an individual level with age, education, and religion, but surprisingly there is only weak difference between men and women.","Klíčová slova: divorce, divorce acceptance, attitudes towards divorce, European Values Study, social norms"

This article focuses on the gender inequalities that are reflected in the construction of men’s and women’s roles and responsibilities in copreneurships (romantic couples in business together) and how those constructions are embedded in societal and the family context. By drawing on qualitative in-depth interviews with copreneurs in Czechia and Slovakia and interviewing each partner separately we are able to analyse how roles are constructed and the justifications given for them as well as identifying how the partners’ constructions of these roles clash. We show how gender inequalities are created and presented as logical and self-evident. By studying copreneurial couples we can examine both their professional and private lives and reveal reveal whether they interact in conflicting or complementary ways. The main contribution of the research is that it provides insight into the seemingly gender-neutral constructions of copreneurial roles, and it employs a methodological approach that has the capacity to identify differences and similarities in copreneurs’ viewpoints. The article highlights the ways in which copreneur constructions reflect the unique contexts of Czechia and Slovakia, a region that to now has been largely unexplored.","Klíčová slova: copreneurship, gender, context, post-socialism, entrepreneurship"

Given that there are large differences between general and vocational programmes in the Czech education system, in terms of the content of education, the conditions of education, student composition, and learning outcomes, it is important to take a deeper look at the causes of these differences. The aim of this paper is to test the original, three-dimensional version of the concept of academic futility at Czech secondary schools. The concept was tested on data obtained from a sample of 4857 students from 29 grammar schools and 90 secondary technical schools who attended the third year of secondary school in the school year 2018/2019. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good model fit with the data for the one-level (student level) and two-level (student and class level) concepts. Measurement invariance was evaluated for different eduational tracks. The potential of using a two-level concept for research on the educational pathways of Czech secondary school students attending various educational programmes is discussed.","Klíčová slova: academic futility, VET, concept validation, confirmatory factor analysis"

Studies demonstrate the practical potential of geo-localised data for criminological and security research. Knowledge about crime concentration at places makes it possible to focus repressive and preventive activities in localities where the most effective results can be achieved. In Czech criminology, limited use has as yet been made of geolocalised crime data or knowledge about the concentration of crime at places. Consequently, this article presents a case study of the concentration of crime at places within a Czech city. One-half of crime is concentrated at 8% of street segments in case study of Czech city. The article builds on the knowledge about the spatial stability of crime and provides a model of urban crime that is applicable to Czech cities. This model is based on data from a case study and considers crime rates and crime concentration patterns in different types of urban environment.

This study analyses them to find answers to several research questions. One question is: who took part in the discussions about the media in the period this analysis focused on in 2018? Interviews with the organisers of these discussions offered a partial answer to the question of what kind of discursive strategies they used in determining the hegemonic discourse that emerges from these discussions. The article’s theoretical starting point is Foucault’s question about ‘Who is speaking?’ as an important element of the archaeology of knowledge. The analysis was conducted by counting the frequency of public normative official affiliations the guests and moderators had in the discussions and performing a qualitative content analysis of the interviews carried out with the organisers. The analysis revealed that most of the participants were politically centrist subjects from centrist parties, the liberal and conservative media, and non-governmental organisations critical of the extremes in the media landscape. The discursive strategies analysed included procedures of exclusion based on the distinction between reason and madness, media routine, and the valuing of objectivity and respect toward the deceased over balance. However, balance is still an acknowledged value and could become the basis for more plural discussions, given that the respondents claimed that they have no problem with differences of opinion.","Klíčová slova: media, discussions, balance, discursive dominance, madness"

With a sample of 10 563 unique users and the aid of negative binomial regression, we test two hypotheses based on previous studies of online dating - namely, that men and women show different partner preferences with respect to age and that women in particular favour age homophily in their contacts. The model results support these hypotheses. Men are observed to prefer younger women, while women prefer men who are the same age or older than they are. Given that there are significantly fewer women on the dating site, they are the ones who choose, and the pairing result depends on whether they respond to a contact or not. The youngest women are contacted by men of all ages. Although men contact much younger women, they have a better chance of success with older women. Our conclusions are thus consistent with international research on homophily in the online environment and to some extent the results correspond to patterns of age homogamy in the Czech Republic. Unlike international research, however, the attractiveness of Czech men is found to decrease as they age.","Klíčová slova: online dating, Czech Republic, age homophily, partner preferences, digital trace data"

The research traced legitimising (justifying and criticising) strategies in authorised documents (governmental organisations) and non-authorised (NGOs and transnational organisations) in the 2010-2017 period. These findings point to the existence of several significantly divergent knowledge 'micro-regimes' that produce various contradictions and tensions on the level of regimes, documents, and the meaning of 'competent' actors. The research tracked the different relationships between managerial, expert, revisionist, revising, and adaptation regimes.

Analysis using exit-poll data covering 161 municipalities and 20 128 voters reveals no relationship between the presence of Roma in a municipality and support for the extreme right. A partial exception seems to be observed for older voters and the university-educated, who are generally the least inclined to far-right support. Interaction effects suggest that, for these groups, Roma presence might be connected to a higher probability to cast a vote for the extreme right. However, a notably higher chance of voting for the extreme right was associated with young, male, manual labourers and people without university education.","Klíčová slova: extreme-right, Slovakia, election, Roma, group-threat"

These developments occurred in a specific political, cultural, and historical context, which affects perceptions of and reactions to surveillance by individual citizens. The post-communist context is characterised by relatively low levels of resistance to the introduction of various technological surveillance mechanisms, including the rapid introduction of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) in public spaces. However, individuals who are under surveillance (surveilled subjects) are not passive. They are aware of the surveillance and its mechanisms, they interact with the surveillance devices, and they self-manage their digital image in various surveillance contexts. Using semi-structured qualitative interviews this article examines experiences of and individual attitudes towards the camera surveillance of Slovak citizens against the wider backdrop of the characteristics of post-communist surveillance culture. It is based on an analysis of individual stories of attitudes towards and personal experiences with CCTV in private, semi-private, and public places. The analysis of individual-level interactions reveals that citizens are aware of the presence of cameras and react to them in various ways, ranging from compliance and various strategies of negotiation with surveillance systems right up to some forms of resistance.","Klíčová slova: surveillance, camera system, CCTV, surveilled subject, Slovakia"

While this movement has mainly spread to Anglophone countries, it is almost entirely absent from Eastern Europe and the Czech Republic in particular. The aim of this paper is to explain why the Transition movement—a grassroots community initiative—has not been successfully adopted in the post-socialist Czech Republic, and why the issue of climate change has not become an important frame for the local permaculture movement which introduced the idea of Transition to the country. The paper presents an analysis of ideological frames and framing processes of the local movement. Reasons identified for the movement’s absence from the Czech Republic include the fact that it was largely overshadowed by the broader post-socialist transformation in Eastern Europe, that there was little public awareness of climate change and no real culture of community organising in the post-socialist period, and that a strong climate scepticism was promoted by Czech political elites. Other reasons relate to the ideological frames of the local permaculture movement, which is centred more on prognostic and mobilising frames, combined with a positive agenda and an emphasis on practical activities, and revolves around individualised strategies and frames in which permaculture and a nature religion (Anastasian spirituality) are linked to the concept of a ‘family homestead’.

This article addresses this ‘satisfaction paradox’ by exploring the perceived work conditions of Czech academics based on their own reports. The data for this study included academics’ (N = 1202) qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding the main problems and benefits of their current academic work and workplace. Content analysis was used to categorise the respondents’ answers. Academics reported heavy workloads (26.5% of participants), a lack of financial resources (26.3%), poorquality leadership (23.7%), excessive administration (16.3%), and job insecurity (10.9%) as the most problematic aspects of their workplaces. In contrast, academics reported that good social relationships in the workplace (46.3%), autonomy of academic work (41.8%), personal fulfilment (28.9%), and work/contact with students (25.3%) were the aspects of their workplaces they valued most. These positive features appear to be prevalent, as most (80%) academics reported overall satisfaction with their work. The authors draw on job demands–resources theory to suggest that the relatively high level of satisfaction is due to (still) high levels of key job resources that support the intrinsic motivation of academics despite an environment that can be considered suboptimal in some aspects. They also point to inequalities in job demands and job resources between subgroups of academics and highlight key systemic issues that should be addressed to improve the work conditions at Czech public higher education institutions.","Klíčová slova: quality of work life, academic staff, job satisfaction, higher education, public universities, job demands, job resources"

Drawing on data from the Life Course 2010 survey and theories that seek to explain low fertility, logistic regressions are used to test what factors are connected to intentions to remain childless and what factors relate to intentions to have just one child. Some factors were founded to be linked to both intentions to remain childless and intentions to have just one child: an older age, a lower level of education, changing reproductive intentions, not having a partner, and less emphasis on the need to be parent to be fulfilled in life. Other factors were found to relate only to intentions to remain childless.

The analysis presents the main lines of argumentation that the respondents used to try to explain and justify their reproductive choices. In their narratives, a single-child family is constructed as the consequence of certain events and transitions in different areas of life and the timing of these events in the linked life paths of the two partners. In a situation where intensive parenting is the normative ideal and where it is also difficult to combine work and a family, and in view of the normative hierarchy of different paths to parenthood that exists (where the preferred path is to have a biological child in a two-parent family), being the parent of single child is becoming an accepted form of parenthood.","Klíčová slova: single-child family, low fertility, parenthood, fertility plans, small families"

Cultural orientation includes different ways of behaving in various life domains (i.e. language use, eating habits, media preferences, or relationships) and attitudes (cultural pride and preference). The questionnaire was administered to two groups of Vietnamese living in the Czech Republic. The second-generation group (N = 279) is made up of ethnic Vietnamese who were born in the Czech Republic and the 1.5-generation group (N = 119) is formed by ethnic Vietnamese born in Vietnam who came to the Czech Republic before they were 12 years old. Using Principal Component Analysis a more complex (six-factor) structure of Czech cultural orientation and a simpler (four-factor) structure of Vietnamese cultural orientation were extracted. The research revealed that the second generation is less oriented towards Vietnamese culture than members of the 1.5 generation, but the degree of orientation towards Czech culture is the same for both groups, and both groups are also oriented more towards Czech culture than Vietnamese culture. A comparison of cultural domains shows that Vietnamese from both generations have a better knowledge of the Czech language than the Vietnamese language, and they claimed to have more contact with Czechs than with Vietnamese people, but both generations also indicated that they were prouder of their Vietnamese cultural heritage than of Czech culture. The results of the research indicate that the Vietnamese from our research sample are successfully adapting to life in the Czech Republic.","Klíčová slova: acculturation, cultural orientation, assimilation, Vietnamese Czechs, General Ethnicity Questionnaire, generational status"

It aims to: a) describe how the authors categorise themselves and determine whether they construct their identity as hybrid; and b) consider whether these texts contribute to the superdiversification of the Czech space. Three identity versions appear in the material: banana children, young ‘uninfected’ Vietnamese, and the younger generation of banana children (BC, YUV, and YG). BC emphasise the hybrid character of their identity, i.e. the necessity of using two languages and behaving in accordance with the norms of two ethnic societies in their everyday lives. YUV declare that competence in Czech and knowledge of the social norms of the majority cannot change the fact that they are Vietnamese. YG assign basically the same features to their own category as to BC. But unlike them, YG usually consider the hybrid character of their identity to be self-evident. That the analysed texts problematise the role of language as a defining feature of ethnic identity can be considered an expression of the superdiversification of the Czech media and new media space. BC defend their right to not belong to a single ethnic society, YUV declare their identity to be exclusively Vietnamese, and MG express amazement that the existence of young Czech-speaking Vietnamese is still surprising to a part of the majority population.","Klíčová slova: superdiversity, Vietnamese, new media, identities"

Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v. v. i., Praha","This study focuses on the approaches used by Czech social workers operating in the field of child protection to resolve parental conflicts and looks specifically at their inclination to employ defensive practice. Defensive practice involves prioritising regulations and prescribed rules over the interests of clients, i.e. parents and children. The aim of this study is to verify, with the help of a questionnaire, the theoretical connections between the use of defensive practice and several factors that represent working conditions and external pressures. The research indicates that the factors connected with the use of defensive practice to deal with parental conflicts have the opposite effect in the Czech Republic that that observed in international studies or have no influence whatsoever. Child protection social workers who emphasise compliance regard their working conditions as favourable and have somewhat conservative attitudes and beliefs. The authors' interpretation of the findings is that the emphasis on regulations in Czech child protection is not a defensive reaction to threatening working conditions, but an expression of loyalty to an organisation that offers them a pleasant work environment where they need not be afraid of any potential failures or consequences of their decisions. They also propose redefining Czech defensive practice by placing less emphasis on compliance as a reaction to unfavourable working conditions.","Klíčová slova: parental conflict, guardianship, defensive practice, social work"

While a statistically significant similarity is observed between mothers and their children, fathers form a more heterogeneous group. The analyses also find a higher level of trust among children from Catholic families, but no connection is observed between generalised trust and a parent's level of education, sex, or the child's age.

One of the issues on which public opinion differs greatly in different regions is the perception of migrants and migration in general. The aim of this paper is therefore to evaluate the extent to which this perception indeed differs across regions, and what factors can explain the variation. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was fielded among secondary-school students in three Czech cities, which proved the existence of significant regional differences in attitudes towards migration. However, these differences greatly depend on how the attitudes are measured - by far the most pronounced differences are found in the attitudes towards the refugees and immigrant groups associated with the recent wave of refugees, attitudes towards whom were three times more negative among students in the Zlín region than among students in Prague. These differences can only partly be explained by the different characteristics of the regions and students. By contrast, friendly contact with foreign nationals seems to be the most vital explanatory variable. The article also presents a model that illustrates the possible process by which individual factors may shape students' attitudes towards migration.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, migration attitudes, spatial differentiation, upper secondary education"

It offers a specific way of linking the discursive and material dimensions of disability, which intersect in the concept of social space, and refers to Lefebvre's trialectics of production - spatial practices, the representation of space, and spaces of representations. To analyse the mutual production of social space and social bodies, we use Goffman's concept of civil inattention. We ask how such social practices as gazing, addressing, asking, or dodging that co-create the social space of electric wheelchair users influence their movement through material space, and through the spatial reactions of wheelchair users responding to unwanted attention we trace the homogenisation and differentiation of space. The text is based on a long-term study (2010-2018) of the temporal/spatial behaviour of five electric wheelchair users (four men and one woman) diagnosed with muscular dystrophy who live in the City of Brno.","Klíčová slova: disability geography, social space, Henri Lefebvre, civil inattention, wheelchair users"

The authors are guided by the assumption that it is necessary to analyse changes in both the structure and the perception of inequality and that the two are interconnected. They assume that some general differences exist as a result of the legacy of state socialism in the three post-communist countries, but also that significant differences exist between those three countries themselves that stem from their different paths of development in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the first part of this article, differences in the societal-political aims of a Western country such as Austria and those of state-socialist countries are discussed. The authors argue that the state-socialist countries were able to contain income inequality but were less successful at limiting other aspects of inequality. Austria, on the other hand, was able to avoid the severe income inequalities of the capitalist system by introducing democratic-corporatist institutions and a strong welfare state. In the second part of the article the authors investigate the subjective perception of inequality based on the ISSP inequality surveys. The majority of the population in all four countries think that income differences are too large, but there are significant differences in how people perceive and evaluate the stratification structure: in Austria, individuals rank themselves significantly higher than do people in the other three countries and see their society as dominated by the middle classes. The opposite is true in Hungary, where most people think that they live in a society characterised by a small elite, and they see the mass of the people at the bottom.","Klíčová slova: social stratification, inequality, Austria, state socialism, perception of inequality"

It examines the patterns of social differentiation in the Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) and attempts to assess changes in the social structure at the subnational level. Social structure changes are explained within the context of broader socio-economic development. The main analyses performed in this study are based on EUSILC micro-data covering 2006–2016 and offer a comprehensive perspective on the patterns of social-stratification development at the regional level utilising three dimensions: social class (proxied by the European Social-Economic Classification), highest attained education level, and income. The results indicate different trajectories in social differentiation across the four countries, although some of the patterns identified are similar. The results indicate that the working class is shrinking and the salariat is growing, and that there are declining shares of people with at most primary or secondary education and increasing numbers with tertiary education. Income inequalities remained relatively stable over the observed period across the Czech and Slovak regions, but fluctuated in Hungarian regions, and the initially greater income inequalities in Polish regions have tended to decline over time. The findings suggest that the least favourable patterns in the development of regional social differentiation are found in the Hungarian regions.","Klíčová slova: social stratification, social class, income, education, regions, Visegrad countries"

Similarly, economic research which views the household as a single unit has been questioned. Changing family circumstances and the increased share of couples in which the woman has higher earnings, education, and socioeconomic status mean that both these perspectives needs reformulating. The authors illustrate these issues using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC) for five Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Austria) and draw on its 2006–2016 time series to present the characteristics of partners in couples and the relations between them. Female primacy has increased either in earnings, education, or socio-economic category in all countries except Hungary. The authors use the EU-SILC 2010 ‘Module on Intra-household Sharing of Resources’ to test the hypothesis that a direct link exists between partners’ social status split and separate welfare status, where female primacy in relevant characteristics is taken as a proxy for social status split, while separate welfare status is indicated by partners’ budgetary discretion. The hypothesis is confirmed for Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, but not for Hungary and Poland. Apart from the personal factors of social status split, two family factors are strongly related to the probability of the budgetary discretion of couple partners across all countries: household income and marital status.","Klíčová slova: social stratification, couples, status split, budgetary discretion, Central Europe"

They use a multilevel model approach and measure education in both absolute and relative terms. The results show that during the time of educational expansion there was no change in the relationship between education and occupation if education is conceptualised in absolute terms. However, a change in this relationship is visible when education is conceptualised as a positional good. Many previous studies that have posed a similar research question did not consider study field. The results here show that the role of study field changed during this time of educational expansion, with natural science, computer, and IT study fields growing stronger than other fields of study.

Based on the ordered logit model, I compute the predicted probability that specific educational pathways would lead to a specific class status. I find that the educational pathway approach yields distinct insights about the education-class link that would be masked had I studied only highest level of education attained.

It draws on empirical research comprising interviews with and ethnographic observations regarding the visually impaired people, in which the concept of assemblage is used as a sociological tool to analyse the continuity and discontinuity of disability. An assemblage is made up of heterogenic, rhizomatic, and often unpredictable connections, both organic and inorganic and linguistic and material, that continuously transform each other. An assemblage is never finished but is always complete, which gives rise to the question of the relationship between a whole and its parts, thus challenging the perception of disability as a lack and making it possible to think of disability in an affirmative sense. Disability can thus be analysed as a dynamic phenomenon that acquires its concrete contours in specific situations and to consider its discursive and material character. Thus, the concept of assemblage captures both the stability and the fluidity of disability and focuses on connections that maintain and decompose it. On the one hand, disability represents hegemonic discourses about health and the body, while on the other hand, it is a breeding ground for subversive processes.","Klíčová slova: disability, assemblage, Deleuze-Guattarian philosophy, dis/continuity, visual impairment"

However, there is also a critique of critique as a disabling tool, replacing the obvious actors revealed as 'fictitious' with synthetic objects that the critic herself deems more 'factual'. This article understands the critical gesture as a pragmatic resource for re-organising the field of dis/abilities. In the first part of the article, we make three critical gestures together with José, a person identified as mentally ill. A paranoid vision of a secret conspiracy, a naturalising concept of disease, and the critique of stigma all seek to radically redraw the dis/ability coordinates, but their emancipatory potential is thwarted by the complex interconnectedness of their objects. José's recovery thus ultimately hinges on a delicate balancing act combining critique and composing. In this sense, his effort resembles the careful treading of lay and professional critics in the last part of our text, in which we try to solve problems of living with dementia together with the Hanuš family. While the critical gesture has an essential role to play here as well, close ethnographic encounters are rather about jointly articulating the critical matters of care, wherein the problematic agencies of both obvious and not-so-obvious actors are acknowledged.","Klíčová slova: critical gesture, dis/ability, impairment, stigma, care"

As part of the reform process, users' and caregivers' representatives were invited by the key stakeholders to participate in working groups, expert committees, and government bodies that associate users' and representatives of parents. At the same time, users and caregivers mobilised from below and participated in a number of bottom-up initiatives. Against this backdrop, this study set out to identify the main positions of patients and caregivers in the Czech process of reforming mental-health care. Moreover, the role of the different forms of knowledge that inspire civic engagement are examined. The study is based on an analysis of semi-structured interviews, primary and secondary sources, and field observations. First, the following four positions taken by users as part of their involvement in the reform of mental-health care are identified: guardians, negotiators, awakeners, and fighters. Second, this study discusses the complexity of relations between users' participation and knowledge, showing that the key source of users' involvement is personal experience, which is difficult to separate from expert knowledge. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the complexity of relations between expertise and experience for users' involvement.","Klíčová slova: mental health, expert knowledge, lay experience, patients' participation, mental health care reform, health social movement"

The public conversation surrounding Bolen's decision, launched through a series of newspaper articles announcing a 'last dance' prom, offers a case-study through which to explore how pain frustrates an analysis of the biopolitical formations that shape both right-to-die discussions and decisions. In doing so, this article offers two interventions. It reveals how dominant views of pain and disability shape and limit how we make sense of Jerika's life and death. It also highlights the analytical leverage that this critical approach offers by reading Bolen's death as a form of what critical theorist Lauren Berlant calls 'slow death' or the gradual wearing out of populations. In this way, I extend conversations within critical theory that seek to trace the slower and more sustained impacts of structural oppression. In looking at the convergence of the biopolitics and necropolitics of disability, race, class, gender, and sexuality, I suggest Bolen's death and the 'last dance' that launched an international public conversation about it function as a celebration of slow death facilitated, in part, by dominant views of pain and disability.","Klíčová slova: disability, pain, biopolitics, slow death, right-to-die"

The analysis first replicates the standard approaches used in previous scholarly research, testing theories of cognitive mobilisation and alienation using the standard regression modelling approach. The results are, however, somewhat inconclusive, as have been the results of previous empirical research in other European countries. It is hypothesised that one reason for this could be data heterogeneity. Both tested concepts could be valid, but for different social groups, resulting in overall inconclusive results. Therefore, latent class analysis (LCA) is then used to show that in the Czech Republic direct democracy is supported both by people alienated from politics and by those satisfied with democracy and democratic governance. The results of empirical analysis show that support for direct democracy in the Czech Republic cannot be explained by any one theory and that different concepts apply to different groups. The article represents a methodological innovative step in the empirical study of sources of popular support for direct democracy.","Klíčová slova: direct democracy, latent class analysis, public opinion, alienation, cognitive mobilisation"

It shows that children (ages 7-12) from low-income households (defined as those with up to 2.4 times the minimum living income) have higher chances of serious problems in school performance if they live in unstable or nonresidential housing. The effects of housing instability and non-residential housing among children from low-income households are significant and substantial even when controlling for parents' educational attainment and labour activity, family structure (e.g. single parent etc.), household size, and the child's age. The effects of other housing problems are significant only in their extreme forms (overcrowdedness) or when combined with other housing problems (the housing cost burden). These findings are used to examine whether the Czech Social Housing Act currently under discussion is needed to help poor families with children and whether it has adequately defined its target group if it is to protect Czech children from the negative effects of inadequate housing.","Klíčová slova: inadequate housing, homeless shelters, moving residence, children, school success/performance, Social Housing Act, poverty, social exclusion, education"

Employing a comparative approach it relates care arrangements to family policy measures. Childcare policies and practices in post-communist countries (the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) are compared in a wider European context and specifically to various countries representing the principal types of welfare state and family policy strategies in Europe (the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, and Sweden). The article focuses on parental leave schemes, parental employment, and formal childcare and takes into account informal childcare, which in many countries is crucial to achieving a work-life balance. The authors' findings reveal that the use of informal childcare is not directly related to either the length of paid parental leave or maternal employment. Informal childcare, which in most cases is provided by grandparents, is used on a weekly basis for at least thirty per cent of preschool-age children in all the post-communist countries studied except Bulgaria. However, similarly high levels of informal childcare were also found in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Austria.

One type of public support-diffuse support-is important for political systems because it provides a source of stability in times of crisis. The existing research on political support in nation-states shows that public support for the political community of the nation tends to be diffuse, while public support for other parts of the political system less so. Is there, like in nation-states, diffuse support for the political community of the European Union? This article argues that there is, and using data from a survey experiment in the Czech Republic finds that support for the political community of the EU is significantly more diffuse than support for the EU's institutions or incumbents.

In this article, we study the development of public support for market economy principles in post-communist countries compared to other European countries between 1999 and 2008, the period that directly followed the initial stage of market transformation. The article is based on data from the European Values Study covering 22 European countries for the years 1999/2000 and 2008/2009. In addition to analysing the trends, multilevel regression models are used to study the determinants and levels of support for the market economy in post-communist and other European countries. When controlling for individual and country-level variables, a significant increase in support for market economy principles is observed in the post-communist cluster, which is not the case in the other countries. There is some inconsistency in support for the individual principles of market economics: support exists in post-communist countries for the notion that the state should be responsible for the social and economic well-being of its inhabitants and for state regulation of the economy, while support is high for some market economy principles, such as free competition and private ownership. In other words, support for some kind of social market seems to prevail among people living in post-communist countries, based on the notion that the state should combine a market economy with relatively generous social policies.","Klíčová slova: market economy, post-communist countries, free competition, private ownership, state regulation of the economy, welfare attitudes"

The Use of Analogy in the Study of Identity Traits",Florentina Scârneci-Domnișoru,Transilvania University of Brașov,"The article presents a new data-collection technique that can be applied in identity studies: analogy. The use of metaphor in identity studies is no novelty, but this particular creative exercise used in sociological research has not been described before in the methodological literature. Three pieces of research in which this technique has been applied are presented here: studies in which participants have been asked to analogise the profession of sociologist, a state-owned company, or a privately-owned company with animals, plants, automobiles musical instruments, or types of meals. The article highlights the special features of the analogy technique, such as the fact that it diminishes the control mechanisms of the participants, making the data that are obtained less sensitive to social desirability. The analogy is presented as an unusual and fun technique that breaks up the routine of the respondent's day-to-day life and is a contrast to the monotonous nature of common tests and questionnaires. Applying this exercise in social research is easy. Analogy obtains meaningful answers from participants and it provides valuable results. Because it is able to access surprising information and a very wide range of identity aspects, analogy can be used in all kinds of social research: sociological, psychological, management, political sciences, communication, social work, public relations, human resources, and others.","Klíčová slova: analogy, metaphorical thinking, creative methodologies, identity, qualitative data"

I also show how constantly performing on the boundary between two worlds, art and sport, and reconciling conflicting requirements influences perspectives on the body, how it is used, and how it physically changes. Drawing on specific examples from the field, the author argues that competition, the use of objects, appearance, emotions, and charisma during a ballroom performance are all socially created, actively reconstructed through social interaction, and shaped by institutional rules. The social context of those actions, which is formed by institutionalisation, high competition, and the aesthetics of the upper social classes, produces a specific approach to the body: treating it as an efficient tool to obtain social status. This tool requires both sharpening (strategies for constructing its effectiveness) and polishing (strategies concerned with aesthetics and transforming one's appearance). The conclusions of the research include the finding that ballroom dancing involves the direct embodiment of cultural norms and the subordination of the human body to the ideas of the bourgeois classes. The above insights are based on data collected during a six-year ethnographic study in the social subworld of competitive ballroom dancing.","Klíčová slova: ballroom dance, sport-sociological perspective, body, institutionalised competition, social aspects of leisure"

It presents an empirical analysis of youtubers, a group that has not yet been studied in the Czech social sciences. Using interpretive phenomenological analysis and in-depth interviews, we show that there is a typical 'career' trajectory that youtubers proceed along, whose structure is determined by experiences of breach of privacy and by mechanisms of reparation. These mechanisms and practices must be employed in order to resolve a fundamental tension between the demand for self-disclosure, arising out of confessional culture and the ideology of authenticity, and the parallel demand for retaining privacy. Breach of privacy is conceptualised as a violation of the equilibrium of its three constitutive elements: content, border, and context. Such situations are experienced as threats to the identity of the youtubers, who seek to avoid these threats by means of reparation practices, changes in how they perform privacy, and the use of what we call tools of controlled (in)accessibility. Unlike normative critiques that lament the loss of privacy on social networks, this article concludes that youtubers are highly competent guardians of their own performed privacy.","Klíčová slova: privacy, social networks, youth, breach of privacy, youtubers"

We show that as long as certain preconditions are met the method proves to be fact and effective, especially with respect to the speed at which it is possible to sample the homeless population. We compare the outcome of the RDS survey with that of a survey of the homeless population in Prague (2010) and assess whether and how the outcomes of the two samples differ in certain population characteristics.

The basic research period was ten years, from 2005 to 2014, and for the Czech Sociological Review the period was extended back to 1995. The results of the content analysis of published articles (N=363) show that statistical tests are applied quite often to data that are not suitable for statistical tests: this is found in about one-fifth of cases in Czech Sociological Review, one-half in Pedagogy, and more than three-quarters in Czechoslovak Psychology. In addition, authors often make mechanical use of statistical methods or make incorrect interpretations (in over 40% of articles in the Czech Sociological Review over the last 10 years) and there are rarely any substantive interpretations of results (especially in Czechoslovak Psychology). Effect sizes are applied relatively often, but there are also gaps in their usage.

A qualitative longitudinal methodology was used to study parental experiences for a period of around four years. Three waves of semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen dual-earner parental couples who had their first child in 2011 or 2012. An analysis of 93 interviews revealed that the fears of the parents-to-be principally concerned childcare, paid work, free time, the relationships, and health. Actual experience of difficulties in these areas was often mentioned by different respondents from those who had expected to have them. The theory of intensive motherhood was employed to underscore the heavy demands and responsibilities placed on contemporary parents and the difficulties that accompany the use of a child-centred approach. The heavy demands on childcare felt by mothers who adhered to the intensive mothering model were cited as causing difficulties in the everyday lives of parental couples; the fathers mainly complained of a lack of rest and quality time with their partners.","Klíčová slova: parenthood, fatherhood, motherhood, fears, difficulties, Czech Republic"

Both the length of the parental leave period and the amount of the benefit have the potential to shape the timing of a subsequent birth. Important changes have been introduced into the Czech parental benefit scheme over the last 10 years in terms of both the scheme's flexibility and the monthly amount of the benefit, which has provided a unique opportunity for studying the links between the institutional conditions of parenthood and the behaviour of real stakeholders. Using data on births from the Czech Statistical Office and the parity-cohort analytical approach, we investigate changes in the spacing of second and third births among women who had their first or second child between 1986 and 2013. The results revealed an increase in the second- and third-birth rate during the second and third year following a delivery, together with a decrease in the second- and third-birth rate during the fourth year and later among mothers exposed to changes in the parental benefit scheme. These changes in reproductive behaviour noticeably coincided with the incentives that have been provided since 2008 by the increased flexibility of the parental leave scheme and the author argues that the option to increase the monthly amount of the parental benefit together with the flexibility of its use has contributed to the closer spacing of births, most notably among more educated women.","Klíčová slova: family policy, parental benefit, reproductive behaviour, birth intervals, education, Czech Republic"

However, it often ignores their organisational aspects. At the same time, in organisation studies there is a large body of literature that focuses on internal organisational structures but disregards working conditions. This article is based on a case study of supermarket cashiers and deals with the flexibilisation of their work. Firms use two forms of flexibility as a cost-cutting strategy: numerical and functional flexibility. Numerical flexibility divides workers into different groups according to their work contract. This enables firms to employ as much labour as they need at a particular point in time. In effect firms reduce the number of employees while intensifying the work of the employees they retain. In the case of functional flexibility the duties and responsibilities attached to a job are redefined. In this respect, I show that the duties of the cashiers in my case study are increased beyond the scope of tasks traditionally attached to this occupation and head towards the model of a universal worker. This shift leads to a decline in qualifications that, combined with technological changes, results in the degradation of work. As a result, flexibilisation processes deepen existing asymmetries in employer-employee relationships and thereby enable firms to transfer a significant amount of market risk onto the shoulders of workers. Moreover, the negotiating position of workers remains weak and their wages low.","Klíčová slova: flexible organisation, numerical flexibility, functional flexibility, precarisation of work, working conditions"

The qualitative analysis shows that the promotion of a company's interests and its positioning at the level of the European Union is not self-evident and results from internal battles in which European public affairs employees play a pivotal role. Under what conditions do the European public affairs employees of a leading multinational firm endorse, manage, and promote an active position in the Brussels' polity sphere? This article highlights the process by which these 'professionals of Europe' adapt to the specific requirements of the EU and mobilise an informal network to contribute to European policy-making. These lobbyists appear as 'double entrepreneurs': as entrepreneurs on behalf of both their employers' interests and the European cause as they place themselves as the auxiliaries of EU civil servants. Maintaining a delicate balance, interest representatives occupy a position of dependence, both on their employer and on the polity field in which they valorise their 'European institutional capital'. This position allows these social agents to serve as a broker between their employer and the European arena. In doing so, they nurture the porosity between (economic) interests and the public sector, which cuts across the field of 'Eurocracy'.","Klíčová slova: lobbying, European Union, corporate influence, policy-making, interest representation"

Using both qualitative (interviews and archives) and quantitative (database) methods, it demonstrates that intermediation activities developed in the late 1980s with the arrival of American law firms, which exported their working methods to Europe. This led to a fierce competition between law firms, which tried to recruit from inside the European Commission. Circulation between the European institutions started to be common and slowly became regulated, a process that gave it legitimacy. While new activities developed for a part of the legal profession, most notably lobbying and intermediation activities, lawyers contributed to blurring the border between the public and the private sphere at the European level. The importance of circulation between the administrative sphere and law firms and the embeddedness between the public and the private sector are thus incentives for overcoming institutional frontiers when studying the European field of power. Because circulation facilitates the development of social networks, common practices, and shared representations, it is essential to maintaining coherence within this 'weak field'.","Klíčová slova: EU studies; sociology of professions, lobbying, revolving doors, political sociology of the EU, legal professions"

When analysing the era of privatisation, recent research on public policy has concluded that public authorities' ability to influence or shape national energy choices has been substantially weakened. Since the mid-2000s, however, tight cooperation between private investors and UK public regulators and policy-makers has emerged as a critical factor to meet the challenges posed by the energy transition. How have the British public authorities tried to get private actors on board and to involve them not only in the delivery and funding of energy services, as has been the case with public-private partnerships, but also in the decision-making process? This article identifies various schemes spearheaded by the UK government to breed or revive innovation in the privately-owned renewable and nuclear energy industries. This analysis explores the various strategies used to facilitate 'decompartmentalising' initiatives and ensure a smooth transition towards a neo-corporatist revival of the Triple Helix involving industry, academia, and government. It shows how these hybrid processes offer valuable insight for analysing and reconceptualising the boundary between the public and the private sectors. Based on this case study, this analysis ultimately demonstrates how the public/private dichotomy should be reassessed using the concepts of hybrid roles and responsibilities.","Klíčová slova: private actors, multi-actor transition, energy transition, governance"

It argues that the emergence of RHW as a specifically understood prime security threat was the result of contingent and often unruly social interactions across different settings, rather than a linear and centralised response to Russia's actions. To capture this process, the concept of 'assemblage' is introduced and then defined as a temporary constellation of a variety of different actors, both public and private. Building on research interviews and documents produced in the RHW field, the authors then proceed in three steps. First, they chronologically trace the gradual emergence of the Czech RHW assemblage from a variety of different actors-bureaucrats, NGOs, academics, journalists-after Russia's attack on Ukraine in 2014. Second, they unpack the inner workings of the assemblage by identifying the key actors and asking who did the assembling and how. Third, they look at how different actors were able to reinforce and/or transform their identities by being part of the assemblage, with an emphasis on the effects this had for the distinction between the public and the private.","Klíčová slova: hybrid warfare, disinformation, assemblage, Russia, Czech Republic"

Focusing on the context of cities, this paper offers a conceptualisation of urban resilience, critically interrogating its use for urban governance and the political implications it has for individual agency. The paper also seeks to contribute to the existing critical literature on urban resilience. The second part of the paper focuses on the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities programme as implemented in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. Empirical data obtained through fieldwork and interviews with representatives of the public sector and civil society suggest that while creating an illusion of inclusiveness and empowerment, the 'resilience approach' has largely ignored the structural conditions of extreme social and spatial inequality in Santiago. Local political realities and private sector interests play an important part in this equation. The case study points to a general tendency to treat city resilience as a technical question, thereby downplaying its deeply political nature.

It is based on data drawn from a large-scale representative survey carried out in the Czech Republic (Neglected Human Capital Dimensions 2015) as the second follow-up to the OECD PIAAC project. The results show that physical attractiveness plays a significant role in tertiary educational attainment, especially in the humanities and social-science disciplines. As for personality traits, Openness to Experience and Extraversion are more beneficial for humanities degrees, whereas Neuroticism significantly decreases a person's chances of obtaining a degree in science. Conscientiousness and Self-esteem have a positive impact on upward educational mobility.

The putative transformation of cultural hierarchies in contemporary society, however, opens up the question of whether it still makes any sense to speak of 'legitimate taste' and eventually of what the nature this legitimate taste might be. This article examines what constitutes legitimate culture in the context of university-level study. It focuses on the differentiation of taste and the way in which the space of cultural consumption is structured by academic disciplines and university faculties. The article draws on data from a questionnaire survey of first- and second-year students at Charles University in 2017 (n = 5127) and conducts a multiple correspondence analysis. It shows that the first dimension of the cultural space of students can be interpreted as the axis of overall cultural capital without any specific differentiation. The third dimension of cultural space, by contrast, convincingly captures a cleavage between traditional cultural capital and a new form of cultural capital. The amount of cultural capital accumulated depends on the kind of academic disciplines studied, but another significant structuring element of cultural capital is the environment of individual university faculties itself.","Klíčová slova: cultural capital, legitimate culture, taste, education, multiple correspondence analysis"

In order to change people's practices and behaviours, it is necessary to first change their beliefs. Studies of beliefs and attitudes draw on a variety of concepts. This study explores the relationship between academic optimism and the mathematical achievement of Czech lower secondary students and follows up on previous studies that confirmed the relevance of this concept for the Czech education system. The data were collected as part of work on the Czech Longitudinal Study in Education (CLoSE) in October 2012 and May 2016. The database used in the analyses contains data from 124 basic schools and 39 grammar schools, and from 4798 students and 1469 teachers. Two-level structural equation modelling showed that there is a statistically significant link between the academic optimism of schools and students' mathematical achievement, even after controlling for prior achievement and socioeconomic status at both the student and the school level.

Wealth inequalities and their development over time are measured here on the basis of the value of the real estate (a flat or house) in which the household lives. The value of household real estate has grown significantly in recent decades in the Czech Republic and Czechs still favour owner-occupied housing over other forms of housing tenure. Households whose parents were also homeowners enjoy an increasingly more evident advantage in acquiring owneroccupied housing themselves. Using selected indicators of income and wealth inequalities, this article shows that in every year observed in this study, wealth inequalities in the form of residential real estate were greater than income inequalities in Czech society. The article also finds that in the observed period lower-income homeowner households recorded lower unrealised yield on the price appreciation of the real estate they live in that higher-income homeowner households did. These findings have significant implications for measuring social inequalities, identifying potential barriers to the entry of new households into the owner-occupied housing segment, and the use of owner-occupied housing as a form of old-age security.","Klíčová slova: inequalities, assets, housing, homeownership, Czech Republic"

Despite the widespread nature of this practice, research in Central Europe has not yet examined this issue at every level of publication administration. The literature that does exist on this subject has mainly focused on national grant programmes, while less attention has been paid to distribution channels at lower-level administrative units. This article focuses on the distribution of subsidies in the municipalities in the Central Bohemia Region between 2014 and 2016. It uses a binary logistic regression to analyse the factors that lead to an application for a subsidy being supported. A negative binomial regression revealed what factors influence the level of subsidy granted. The results of the analysis show that party ties have a strong effect on the odds of a municipality obtaining a subsidy. This factor, however, has less of an effect on how large a subsidy the municipality obtains, and moreover only does so when the distribution of funding is taking place before an election.","Klíčová slova: distributive politics, pork-barrel politics, grants, municipalities, regions, Czech Republic"

It focuses on the political opportunity structure (i.e. the structure of relationships that affect social and political behaviour) and questions whether this structure affects also women's political representation. It shows that women are significantly advantaged in municipalities where women have held a mayoral post in a previous electoral term. In contrast to other studies, previous women's representation in a municipal council is here found to have only a limited effect. The strong negative effect of the direct election of mayors and the negative effect of municipal size (only in Slovakia) indicate that women's representation as mayors may be the result of interdependent phenomena that are a combination of institutional structure (e.g. electoral procedure, the mayor's powers) and political contextual factors (past experience with a female mayor - not necessarily incumbents). This finding challenges earlier studies and it shows that any effort to identify a clear list of determinants of women's representation as mayors is a complex task, making it difficult to pursue a broader comparative study in a different institutional environment or a different political culture.","Klíčová slova: local politics, local elections, women and politics, women's representation, women mayors, Czech Republic, Slovakia"

The main aim is to show the impact of geographical context, sociodemographic characteristics, and characteristics connected with political experience on mayors' preferences for different mayoral agendas.

At the same time, there is growing public awareness of gender role equality. However, there is little evidence on whether there has been any change in the perception of fairness in the division of housework and whether this view differs in different families. Using data from the ISSP 2002 and 2011/2012, this article seeks to explore the relationship between the division of housework and its perceived fairness. Using latent class regression analysis four distinct types of housework division and perceptions and individual characteristics that predict cluster membership of housework division are identified. The most prevalent type are couples in which there is a traditional division of housework and who divide further into two groups based on whether they view this division is fair or unfair. Cohabiting couples are more likely than married couples to share housework equally and to see this arrangement as fair. Based on a distributive justice perspective, important predictors of cluster membership are found to be relative income, economic activity, gender, and partnership status. However, the findings provide only limited evidence of any change in the division of housework and perceptions about housework in the Czech Republic over the last decade.","Klíčová slova: division of labour, fairness, housework, unmarried cohabitation"

It examines the factors that influence migrants' simultaneous negotiation of 'belonging' in the home and host societies. This question is particularly significant in the 'liquid' context of free intra-EU mobility. The analysis is based on semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in 2014-2016 with 41 Czech migrants who had moved to the United Kingdom in 1990-2015. Building on existing research of Central and Eastern European migration, the article shows that despite their diverse trajectories, most interviewees strive for 'grounded' lives with a family and a predictable future. Their sense of 'belonging' is affected by their reasons for coming to and staying in the UK, but especially by the presence or absence of agency; whether the migrant's decision to stay was voluntary or dependent. Aspects of the individual's migration situation and personal characteristics are also shown to structure migrant belonging. The concept of a 'leap of faith' is introduced to capture the role of a conscious commitment to settling in the host country, both physically and mentally, and thus re-gaining 'control' over one's migration trajectory in cases when the decision to stay was not made independently.","Klíčová slova: liquid migration, settlement, belonging, reasons for coming and staying, agency"

The Legacy of Czechoslovak Ethnography and Folklore Studies in Czech Anthropology,Nikola Balaš,"Faculty of Humanities, Charles University, Prague","One issue of the post-socialist transformation of Czech higher education has been the many attempts to establish an independent discipline of sociocultural anthropology. As many observers noted, the establishment of a fully-fledged Czech anthropology after the collapse of communism in 1989 proved to be a rather difficult task. Many accounts offered various explanations for the uneasy state of emerging Czech anthropology, but none of them focused on the specific academic practices that anthropology inherited from its predecessor-Czechoslovak ethnography. While anthropological names, books, and theories entered wide circulation and have become a regular part of curricula since the 1990s, the specific way ethnography is practiced has remained unchanged. The article looks at the Department of Ethnography and Folklore Studies at Charles University, which, in the 1990s, became one of the departments where students were able to take courses in anthropology. While the students were given an introduction to anthropological knowledge, they were not led to adopt the specific set of scholarly attitudes that are intrinsic to sociocultural anthropology, the most important of which is a specific approach to academic debates. It could be concluded that this uneven distribution of academic expertise, this disunion between knowledge and non-knowledge, may have severely delayed the development of an autonomous tradition of Czech sociocultural anthropology.","Klíčová slova: culture of contention, postsocialism, higher education, history of anthropology, history of ethnography and folklore studies"

This paper uses a Hungarian household survey with approximately 3400 individual observations. The fluctuation in satisfaction over the course of the week is assessed according to the day on which the personal interview was conducted during a six-week period of fieldwork. The analysis investigates the extent to which this is the result of a random process. Unlike previous analysis, the nadir in satisfaction (in Hungary) is found to occur midweek. This is explained as being related to workload. The results are robust after controlling for the interviewers' unobserved characteristics or the hour of completion of the interview. Modification in workdays owing to national holidays did not alter the results. The results reveal which social groups are especially vulnerable to fluctuations in satisfaction. This could have practical consequences for a more efficient work-life balance. The paper suggests questions for future research, which in particular should seek to understand differences between nations in terms of the nadir of satisfaction and to find a solution to the self-selection problem that may result in an underestimation of the true size of the weekly nadir.","Klíčová slova: weekly rhythm in satisfaction, day-of-the-week effect, mid-week effect, satisfaction with life"

The advantage offered by the intersectional perspective is illustrated in an analysis of EU-SILC data. The analysis combines an additive and multiplicative (intersectional) approach to research on unemployment in the Czech Republic. An additive model of binary logistic regression is accompanied by binary logistic regression models with interactions. The aim is to identify the factors and the social positions that result from the interaction of these factors that together influence chances of unemployment. The analysis shows that one source of inequality in interaction with other sources can have an entirely different impact on chances of unemployment than individual factors have on their own. An example is the interaction of gender and parenthood, which creates different social positions for different subpopulations. Motherhood, fatherhood, and the absence of the need to care for a young child can generate specific (dis)advantages for women or men also depending on the nature of their employment.","Klíčová slova: intersectionality, unemployment, inequalities, gender, logistic regression, interactions"

Empirical analyses are conducted on data from the 7th wave of the ESS from 2014 and three indicators of personal wellbeing are used: a depression scale, self-reported happiness, and life satisfaction. The analyses show that spending childhood in a conflict-ridden family affects mainly the emotional side of personal wellbeing (happiness, depressive symptoms).

Men also provide care, but they are less likely to do so, the intensity of the care they do provide is not as great, and the care activities they engage in are of a different type than those performed by women. This article seeks to answer two questions: What share of Czech women and men are caring for an elderly member in the family? Do the experiences of sons and daughters as caregivers differ? For this purpose the article presents a quantitative analysis of the Wave 5 of the SHARE 2013 dataset and a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with men and women caring for their frail elderly mother (and father). The results indicate that although the share of men providing some care in the CR is similar to the share of women, as carers men spend less time providing care, and they are more likely to care for their wife or partner than for other family members. Daughters are more likely to be the ones who provide care when an elderly parent needs more intensive help. Qualitative data indicate that when caring for their parents, men and women tend to 'do gender', if not in their care practices, then in their narrations of care. Men tend to provide care that is 'good enough' (instead of 'the best' care) and to use managerial and expert discourse when talking about care.","Klíčová slova: elderly care, gender, family, intergenerational support, masculinities"

Inspiration for the conceptualisation of the subject of this study comes from the field of critical security studies and specifically the Copenhagen and Aberystwyth schools of security and feminism. Empirically, the study draws on the author's long-term experience conducting fieldwork in socially excluded localities, mainly in the socially excluded locality Havířov-Šumbark. The study concludes that insecurity cannot be reduced to just the issue of crime or violence, as existing scholarship has done. An element of insecurity in socially excluded localities is also represented by territorial stigmatisation and structural victimisation, that is, fear of the consequences of symbolic pollution and declining living standards or low social status. Symbolic stigmatisation and structural victimisation have a constraining effect on how inhabitants of excluded localities live their everyday lives, albeit in different ways than street crime does.","Klíčová slova: insecurity, socially excluded localities, physical violence, street crime, territorial stigmatisation, structural victimisation"

It aims to contribute to the discussion of how the current transformation of science and the academic work environment has impacted gender equality and women's careers in academia. A life-course approach is used to analyse the interplay between individual, institutional, and structural barriers in women's careers. Drawing on in-depth narrative interviews, the analysis focuses on the interaction between academic research work paths, institutional and organisational conditions, and family paths and examines the milestones that formed the career paths of women now and in the past, how the dynamics of an academic research career have changed, and how the ways and conditions for combining work life and motherhood have changed. The author argues that the neoliberal transformation of the academic labour market and current Czech family policy leave women increasingly less able to fit their life biography into their preferred career model than they could before 1989.","Klíčová slova: gender, academia, research, life-course, women, careers"

It draws on secondary data from several surveys and examines whether the use of preschool varies by parental education and income. Combined with data on preferred employment regimes, the article explores the question of whether parents with higher levels of education and income are advantaged when it comes to their children attending preschool. The results show that the use of preschool facilities is relatively uniform across Czech households. While preschool attendance is not very common among children up to the age of three, after three years of age daily, full-day attendance predominates, with 94% of children aged five attending preschool. While there are no significant educational differences between mothers in the use of preschool care, there are when it comes to preferences. It is significantly more often university-educated mothers who are found to use institutional childcare less than they would like to, and it is they who are also more often found to be at home with their preschool-age child despite their wishes otherwise. Institutional provisions thus prevent women who would like to return to work earlier or work more than the system allows from pursuing their preferences. The results also show that access to institutional care significantly structures the income opportunities of households (rather than it being that households' income opportunities structure the use of care), and subjective assessment also confirm this.","Klíčová slova: ECEC in the Czech republic, educational diversification, social reproduction in education, mothers' preferences regarding preschool education"

This article presents an overview of social-science research on health and pregnancy among migrant women and on the perinatal and postpartum care they receive. Research on 124 studies on this subject revealed that there are three main themes associated with maternal health in this context: (1) How women are defined and categorised as migrants: This is often based on a single indicator, country of origin or birth. This creates a simplified and homogenising category that then also serves as the basis for the use of more complex categories. (2) The significance of social support for families, especially with respect to informal care, and the fundamental role of language and language barriers in health care. The relationship between migrant women and health-care providers is impacted by cultural differences, which leave women in a vulnerable position. (3) Macro-sociological and epidemiological factors. These are discussed mainly from the perspective of the 'epidemiological paradox', which the authors here deem a rhetorical trick because it conceals the variableness of the findings obtained from perinatal health indicators.","Klíčová slova: perinatal health, healthy immigrant effect, acculturation, migrant women, epidemiological paradox, health care"

Despite the great body of research devoted to the issues of grandparenthood, most attention, both locally and internationally, has been given to women and grandmotherhood. To overcome this shortcoming, we present findings based on eleven qualitative interviews conducted with men with diverse grandparenting experiences and performing various forms of caring practices. Grandparenting is a negotiated, relational, and highly gendered social role, which we explored in our research through our respondents' narratives focused on everydayness and memories of their own experience as a grandchild. Based on their self-reflective narratives we were able to describe the performative potential of grandparenting and define four types of activities through which grandfather roles take shape. On this basis we were also able to describe the spatio-temporal aspects of these practices, which proved to be crucial for understanding of gender issues of grandfatherhood. Although the narratives of the participants in our research reflect an active approach to fulfilling the grandparenting role, their caring practices are still predominantly structured in a gender-stereotyped way. In terms of theory, our research results build on and seek to contribute to one of the most influential theoretical models of grandfathers' involvement proposed by Bates and Taylor.","Klíčová slova: ageing, old age, grandparenting, grandfathers, masculinities, grandchildren"

The research is based on three kinds of data: the official state-socialist public discourse of economic behaviour as presented in transcripts of parliamentary speeches, household guides and manuals, and eyewitness accounts of the state-socialist era recollected in oral history interviews. Such a multi-faceted corpus of discourse data made it possible to examine factual and normative aspects of thrift in state-socialist discourses and compare them with the accounts of everyday practices and tactics that may well contradict the official discourse. The analysis reveals that (a) notions of thrift and saving were strongly present throughout the period in all discourses examined, (b) both terms underwent a semantic shift from a productive to a restrictive meaning over time, and (c) both notions were eventually publicly sidelined by the emphasis on raising revenue. Despite fading from public discourse in the late 1980s, the notion of thrift had by then become instilled in the subjective understanding of the 'reasonable consumer', a concept that can therefore be considered a precursor of the contemporary concept of consumer responsibilisation.","Klíčová slova: thrift, saving, discourse analysis, socialism, consumers, consumer responsibilisation"

Many scholars draw on Inglehart's concept of post-materialism and consider voluntary simplicity to be a way of limiting one's consumption in order to free oneself and seek satisfaction in the non-material aspects of life. These scholars assume that the values associated with simplicity emerge out of over-saturation with consumption. This article discusses the results of research conducted among Czech households who voluntarily reduce consumption and who do so in a post-socialist context, without having first lived in affluence. Theoretically and methodologically, the article builds on the work of Hana Librová [1994, 2003; Librová et al. 2016] and is rooted in three main concepts: the concepts of post-materialism [Inglehart 1977], 'new luxury' [Enzensberger 1996], and the normative ethical theories of motivation [Pelikán and Librová 2015]. The findings of the study call into question Inglehart's structural assumption that non-consumption lifestyles like voluntary simplicity only develop in affluent societies and suggest that the Czech socialist past created conditions suitable for the emergence of a non-ideological and primarily self-oriented version of voluntary simplicity. The roots of simple lifestyles may also lie in people's dissatisfaction with the promise of modernity, a promise suggesting that it is possible to attain and lead the good life through material abundance. Prior experience with an affluent lifestyle did not play a role in the decision of participants in this study to live a nonconsumption lifestyle. This study in a post-socialist country therefore has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the motivations for choosing voluntary simplicity.","Klíčová slova: voluntary simplicity, non-consumption lifestyles, theory of postmaterialism, motivations for simplicity, post-socialism"

It examines the resources family members employ family discourse to interpret and justify their economic behaviour, and puts forth the hypothesis that economic terms are re-articulated through everyday practices in the family world and that conversations inoculate expert terms with specific meanings. The article introduces the moral economy as a crucial principle of sense-making in family economic discourse and highlights the perception of the future as a key distinction between financial market economies and family-specific moral economies. Three mechanisms by which finance is domesticated are identified: (1) narrativisation-where financial objects are interpreted through the narratives of family history; (2) appropriation-where financial objects are embedded in the family moral economy; and (3) affectivation-where emotions change the meanings attached to financial objects. Narrativisation situates financial objects in time, appropriation sets them in the context of the family-specific moral economy, and affectivation connects them with personal identity and authentic experience.","Klíčová slova: family, discourse, economy, financialisation"

The research was inspired by an ethnomethodological approach to lived order and psychological knowledge-derived from Buddhism-on how the mind works. Some inspiration was also drawn from symbolic interactionism. The experiment was aimed first at discovering the basic assumptions underlying our everyday activities. A second and more important goal was to deconstruct the work of the mind, especially with respect to the process of the looking-glass self and 'producing' emotions. The article also discusses the use of the self-study method (ethno-Zenic experiments) to deconstruct the mind as part of a lived order in a certain location and, in the wake of that, mindfulness.","Klíčová slova: qualitative methods, Zen Buddhism, public places, lived order, contemplative sociology, ethnomethodology"

The goal is to create a profile of youth with emigration experience and examine the interrelation between two transitions, from education to work and from youth into adulthood, as measured by the degree of independence from parents, and also to investigate social inequalities among people with emigration experience in the transition from education to finding a first job. The analysis is based on theories of the individual life-course transition and social status theories. The empirical data were gathered from a representative survey conducted in Bulgaria in 2014 that focused on young people aged 15-34 who had left education within the previous five years. The results show that young people from large families with many siblings more often have emigration intentions and that previous emigration experience is the strongest predictor of emigration intentions. Emigration intensions are also more likely among people who have emigrated and later returned and ended up economically inactive. This fact is important in understanding the large number of young people who are not in education or employment (NEETs) in Bulgaria.","Klíčová slova: emigration intentions, emigration behaviour, school-to-work transition, social inequalities"

Owing to increased international mobility since the 1990s, it has also become relevant for some post-socialist cities. This article examines how the growing ethnic heterogeneity of the urban population is reflected in the spatial distribution of foreign citizens in Prague, which is now a unique example of a newly multicultural post-socialist capital. The analysis uses the migration register and census data based on citizenship. The results suggest that foreign citizens are a factor in the transformation of the ethnic structure of the population especially in the inner city and the historical core. Ethnic segregation appears to be most pronounced among economically stronger and culturally distant groups, but concentrations of foreign citizens are forming on the level of localities rather than urban quarters.

The authors analyse the consequences of the educational expansion that occurred between 2000 and 2014 and its effect on economic and non-economic returns to education. The number of people with a university degree almost doubled between 2000 and 2014 in the Czech Republic. It is analysed whether this caused an inflation of education at the Czech labour market, or whether highly educated people are still employable in prestigious and well-paid jobs due to technological changes. The data used in the analysis are drawn from the Czech Labour Force Survey and the Survey of Average Earnings in the Czech Republic. Both sources support the theory of technological change over the theory of inflation of education. In the Czech Republic, returns to education did not decrease but slightly increased during the period analysed. The Czech labour market is undergoing technological changes. It is therefore not yet sufficiently saturated with university-educated employees and it was capable of offering them jobs with appropriate socioeconomic status, adequate job security, and a substantially higher salary both during and after the period of educational expansion.","Klíčová slova: returns to education, educational expansion, inflation of education, technological change, human capital"

This article provides an overview of commonly applied definitions of the fourth age. It focuses on concepts that do not view the fourth age as an unavoidable stage in life but rather as a stage in which the shared vulnerabilities and responsibilities for care that some older adults may experience need to be recognised. The article devotes a more in-depth discussion to the issue of agency in the fourth age, the possibilities for the existence of agency, and forms of agency. It challenges the idea that the fourth age is a stage in life without agency and argues that agency can be identified through its relational definitions. It also highlights the problems of understanding independence in the context of advanced old age. The article draws attention to the risk of greater polarisation in old age that lies in the positive value ascribed in current social gerontology to the dominant concept of the third age and in associating the negative stereotypes of old age with just the fourth age. The conclusion highlights the problems surrounding the possibility of active ageing in the fourth age.","Klíčová slova: fourth age, oldest-old, agency, independence, life course, autonomy, active ageing, frailty, identity"

Nešpor,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i., Praha","This article focuses on Czech sociologists who left Czechoslovakia immediately after the communist coup in February 1948 and their subsequent academic and personal fates in exile. Attention is devoted principally to Otakar Machotka (1899-1970), a prominent figure in both Czech political life and pre-Marxist Czech sociology with strong personal and methodological ties to the Chicago School; this article's research draws on his correspondence and on other archived sources. Machotka's special circustances worked to his favour in the United States where he was offered excellent academic positions. However, Machotka was opposed to the sociological mainstream(s) of his time and (unsuccessfully) attempted to establish his own school between sociology and social psychology. After that he accepted a tenured position at a marginal non-research university and failed to gain an audience in wider American or international academia. On a personal level, he preferred to focus on his family and social work rather than to take part in the academic game. In this he was perhaps influenced by the bleak fates of two of his colleagues in exile, František Rouček (1891-1952) and Zdeněk Ullrich (1901-1955), both of whom gave priority to their professional careers, which took them to Africa, where they both met an early death. Members of the youngest cohort of Czech post-February 1948 exiled sociologists, however, enjoyed happier fates, gaining some international academic renown, but only after graduating (anew) from western universities.","Klíčová slova: Machotka Otakar, Czech sociology, sociological emigration, history of sociology, communism"

We use data from the first large-scale sociological survey focusing on physical attractiveness carried out in Europe and in particular from the follow-up to the Czech national survey of adult competencies (PIAAC). First, using structural modelling to identify differences in how men and women transform family background, formal education, competencies, socio-economic status of occupation and physical attractiveness into income, we found strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that, in general, physically more attractive people have better chance of obtaining a higher socio-economic status occupations, and higher incomes than less attractive people, but the causalities are different for men and women. Second, replicating the linear regression models applied to North American data we assessed the differences in returns to beauty between Czech men and women and found that, unlike in North America, in the Czech Republic the income premium for beauty is markedly higher among women than men, while men capitalise on their attractiveness more in the area of occupational status. We conclude that while returns to beauty are culturally universal, gender differences in these returns are culturally specific.","Klíčová slova: attractiveness, human capital, skills, education, labour market outcomes, gender gaps, structural modelling"

We focus on two aspects of the everyday geography captured by photovoice: (1) movement in space and (2) the performativity of heterotopic places. The aim is to understand how the research partners as actors (re)present and (re)construct their everyday geography by visual means and how they relate to it affectively (or otherwise). Photovoice is a suitable method for this type of research as it has been used across the social sciences and especially in action research as a productive tool that allows people to document and reflect on their everyday life, their strengths, and their concerns, and to communicate all this effectively to the wider public. In this article, we critically discuss photovoice and argue that besides its action potential, it can also be used to generate rich visual research data. We present data collected from photovoice research on homeless people in Prague and Pilsen, two cities in the Czech Republic, and conduct formal analytical and hermeneutic analyses of the data. The photographs we obtained reveal the movement of our research partners - the homeless - in space and their relationship to different places and the people in them. In general, people were the most frequently photographed theme. The research revealed that social relations are the most important aspect in the creation and production of places in cities. Several factors, most importantly age, influence the extent to which social relations play this role.","Klíčová slova: photovoice, visuality, affect, social relations, public space, place, everyday geography, heterotopia, homeless, Czech Republic"

We test several hypotheses derived from the individualisation theory. While approximately one half of 'solo mothers' had no co-residential partner at the time they had their first child, almost 50% of them did enter a co-residential partnership subsequently. The probability of transitioning into a co-residential partnership increased over cohorts. Whereas about 25% of solo mothers from the oldest cohort (first child born before entered a co-residential partnership with the 20 years after having their first child, in the youngest cohort the figure was almost two-thirds. The highest odds are among very young solo mothers.

Usually these are a categorical, ordinal type of variable. However, in a quantitative analysis of the inter- and intragenerational reproduction of church attendance categorical variables may have some disadvantages and limitations. This article discusses and tests the possibilities of a different methodological approach, where ordinal variables indicating the frequency of church attendance are transformed into numerical-type variables. More simply put, respondents are asked how many times a year they attend church and this information is expressed in a new variable. There are a few analytical advantages to this numerical variable. First, the information on the frequency of church attendance is not divided up into multiple categories and can be transposed for use in multivariate analysis. Second, even if there are only a small number of cases in the data set there is no need to reduce the categories of variables. Third, the results of the analysis can be presented as a single numerical value. The individual examples in this analysis focus narrowly on the rates of inter- and intragenerational reproduction of church attendance, and the analytical possibilities of numerical variables on attendance rates are tested on data from the Religion module of the International Social Survey Programme 2008.","Klíčová slova: frequency of church attendance, methodology of quantitative religious research, numerical variable, intergenerational and intragenerational transmission"

This study contributes to this field of research by testing the potential of resilience as a capacity to adapt in the face of adversity through individual and social resources and is the first European study to investigate how resilience predicts survival in later life. Panel data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe are used to determine the predictors of survival among people over the age of 75 between waves 1, 2, 4, and 5. The results of a multilevel logistic regression show that resilience is a strong predictor of survival among the oldest old and that this is true even when controlling for the amount and severity of adversity. Resilience is found on its own to be a stronger predictor of survival in women, while the amount and severity of adversity is more important in men. Resilience is therefore found to be an important factor in longevity and survival in later life and the stronger effect of resilience in women can partly explain the 'gender paradox'. To sum up, resilience is observed to be protective against decease, especially through the use of social resources, which are stronger among women and which are not measured in most traditionally used resilience scales.","Klíčová slova: resilience, older age, longevity, gender, SHARE"

Structural modelling, based on representative data from the Czech follow-up to the PIAAC international research project (2015), reveals the validity of the links between values and personality traits, which is still sometimes overlooked in psychology. The relationship between values and personality traits is more complex than most psychological studies assume, as some personality traits that might be expected to have a strong cognitive component are influenced more by values, while others, vice versa, are weakly associated with values. A new hypothesis then is that the influence of values on traits largely occurs on a conscious level, has a decidedly cognitive basis, and may vary in the long term and change its polarity in response to strong confrontations with the social environment, while the strength and polarity of the influence of personality traits on values remains stable over time.","Klíčová slova: human values, personality traits, cognitive ability, PVQ scale, NEO-Five Factor Inventory, non-recursive structural modelling"

The hidden agenda in this criticism is political: the charges are that Parsons supposedly disavows democracy in his implicit or explicit knowledge aim, and that his sociology presumably makes society function even at the expense of freedom of the individual. Here the author argues that these accusations cannot stand if archival materials such as lecture notes, correspondence, and unpublished memoranda are taken into account. She claims that Parsons in his sociology conceptualised society from the standpoint of the real world of the day, including the major historical confrontations from the 1930s to the end of the 1970s. The first such scenario and the earliest confrontation that his work faced was in the era of the New Deal and the Second World War as the Anglo-Saxon democracies fought the racist imperialism of Nazi Germany; his 'middle phase' from the 1950s to the mid-1960s coincides with the Cold War at its height, the standoff between the capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union; and his 'late oeuvre' has yet another agenda, namely the Watergate Affair, but also the struggle for racial equality and university reform in the United States. In his theoretical positions and in his opposition to his critics, Parsons defended liberal democracy against the powerful social and intellectual forces that put it to the test.","Klíčová slova: Talcott Parsons, history of sociology, American sociology, system theory, public intellectuals"

This study examines if the effect of party leaders on party choice has increased as the vote personalisation literature suggests. Alternative explanations of party choice emphasise the stable role of cleavages and left-right orientation, leaving limited space for leadership effects and their growth. In addition, this paper also tests party-specific hypotheses. These hypotheses are tested using four Czech post-election surveys (1996-2013). Vote choices are modelled using stacked data matrices (for each election) and a logistic regression estimator. An instrumental variable approach is used to deal with the endogeneity between vote choice and party identification. The results show that there has been no increase in party leadership effects in the Czech Republic. Party leader effects are largely stable across the four elections examined. The article reveals that party leaders play a greater role in the decision-making calculus of voters of new populist non-leftist parties; however, the effects are not large.","Klíčová slova: leader effects, party identification, personalization of politics, elections, Czech Republic"

An analysis of survey data collected in primary and secondary schools in four regions in 2014 (N = 1,959) reveals that among young Czechs general support for a democratic regime is relatively independent from more specific pro-democratic attitudes (although there is an association between general support for democracy and the abstract principle of freedom of speech). On a general level, democracy was supported by about two-thirds of adolescents in the sample. Similar or even higher levels of support were found for the two principles of democracy when presented in abstract terms. However, when these principles were presented to them in specific, less clear-cut contexts, support for them was much lower. Specifically, despite their strong support for free speech, about half of respondents supported restricting unconventional political activism.

Many scholars think that social stratification of the electorate may lead to differential political representation of social groups thereby weakening the legitimacy of democracy among the lower social strata who participate least in politics. In this respect, it is often argued that one of the roles of schools is to reduce the difference in civic participation among students coming from families in different social strata. In this vein, this article examines if (a) type of classroom learning operationalised as 'open classroom climate' and (b) the socioeconomic composition of the class help to explain differences in students' level of civic knowledge and attitudes toward voting. The data used in this study comes from the International Citizenship and Civic Education (ICCS) survey of 8th-grade student carried out in 2009. The multilevel modelling results show that the SES of a students' family does help to explain differences in pupils' civic knowledge and attitudes toward voting, and this classroom effect is especially strong among low SES students. In contrast, the presence of an open classroom climate has no significant effects on knowledge or attitudes to voting. This article concludes with a discussion of how these findings shape current understanding of how contrasting educational trajectories may have political consequences over the long-term.","Klíčová slova: inequality, family background, civic knowledge, open classroom climate, voting turnout"

This article draws on a multidimensional concept of disadvantage to study spatial aspects of disadvantage in Czech rural areas. Current studies aimed at identifying 'inner peripheries' as areas with an increased risk of social exclusion fail to distinguish between different forms of disadvantage. Their methodological approach blends regions struggling with various problems into one category. Contesting the one-dimensionality of peripheries, this article presents an alternative approach that allows the delimitation of multiple types of peripheral areas based on four separate dimensions of disadvantage. It is possible then to distinguish: peripheries characterised by low qualifications, lower living standards, and the absence of a middle class; peripheries with an increased risk of social exclusion; peripheries with poor accessibility; and peripheries facing demographic challenges. Differences in the spatial patterns of the four types of peripheries indicate that different sociospatial processes contribute to the emergence of different types of peripheries and this calls for varied public policy tools and measures.","Klíčová slova: peripheries, disadvantage, area deprivation, public policy, rural areas, social exclusion, Czech Republic"

The hermeneutical problem in sociology is exemplified by research into social action that examines how sociological understanding captures meanings attributed to the action by the actors themselves. Although several distinguished theorists have already introduced the idea of hermeneutics into sociology, none of them pursued the topic of the hermeneutical circle in detail. This article applies the hermeneutical circle to sociology through the concepts of 'pre-understanding' and the 'fusion of horizons'. The analysis results in the acknowledgement of epistemological pluralism in sociology and leads to the conclusion that the justification of truth in sociology cannot be simply a matter of correspondence-based verification, but must involve a form of decision-making about true knowledge within an intersubjective sociological rationality.","Klíčová slova: hermeneutics, social action, rationality, epistemology, sociological theory"

The heterogeneous nature of home schooling is explored here through the theoretical frame of the anthropology of education, with a more narrow focus on different parental ethnotheories (Harkness and Super) and the theory of capital (Bourdieu). Set against primary research, represented by two case studies, the article shows how families that practise home schooling enter the game of capital, how they justify their decisions, and how they negotiate their difference. Based on personal practice these families contribute to the overall transformation of the field of education. Given that they do so not from the position of a lobbyist or a movement leader but from a position where they are convinced of their ideological and action isolation, the author concludes that it is possible to consider here a parallel with cultural creativism.","Klíčová slova: home schooling, anthropology of education, ethnotheory, cultural creatives"

Political and economic reforms in the 1990s led to changes in ethnic composition, and the attention given to the processes of ethnic-segregation has started to increase. While most studies focus on capital cities, much less is known about second-tier cities. This article examines the interrelationships between ethnic and social segregation in the metropolitan areas of Lithuania (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda). The authors use Lithuanian census data from the years 2001 and 2011 to obtain insight into the recent changes in the socio-spatial differentiation of the largest ethnic groups: Lithuanians, Poles, and Russians. The results show a clear relationship between the socioeconomic and ethnic status of the residents of metropolitan areas and, therefore, suggest that ethnic segregation is strongly linked to the general processes of social segregation. The findings also show that the larger the proportion of a certain ethnic minority group in an area, the larger the proportion of lower (social) status residents in this group. In addition, in such cases, ethnic minorities often tend to concentrate in particular areas within the cities.","Klíčová slova: socio-ethnic segregation, metropolitan areas, Lithuania"

The article has three main objectives. First, it analyses inertia and change in socio-spatial patterns and evaluates the processes that have influenced them. Second, it investigates how the importance of all three statuses in the spatial differentiation of urban space has evolved. Third, the article focuses on the level of geographical variability as recorded within different spatial scales, and the development of this variability. It examines selected indicators of socio-economic, demographic, and ethnic statuses by employing detailed statistical data on the level of basic settlement units from the Population Censuses held in 1970, 1991, and 2011. The results confirm that the most significant changes in socio-spatial patterns between socialism and post-socialism can be observed for ethnic spatial differentiation. In addition, the city witnessed considerable changes in demographic spatial patterns in both periods, while socio-economic spatial patterns have remained relatively stable. New socio-spatial processes driven predominantly by movements of young and better-off populations have taken place in previously less attractive neighbourhoods. As a result, very different populations often live side-by-side in contemporary Prague.","Klíčová slova: socio-spatial differentiation, socialist and post-socialist city, population census, spatial variability, Prague"

It was expected that large housing estates in Poland might experience social decline in the 1990s, but several research projects conducted in the estates did not identify any increase in social degradation. This article examines the social structure of the residents of large housing estates in Poland and identifies the main trends in current social changes. The time frame of ongoing transformations in the social structure was set around the turn of the 21st century. This analysis is based on Polish 1988 and 2002 National Census data, the Polish PESEL population database (2011), and the author's survey data (2010-2012). Research was conducted in seven housing estates in fi ve Polish cities or towns (Poznań, Kraków, Tarnów, Dzierżoniów, and Żyrardów) and focused on analysing the sizes and types of households and their economic situation and the social structure of the estates. Results showed that large housing estates continue to have a heterogeneous social structure and to resist social deprivation processes. Depending on the period when a particular estate was built it is possible to observe distinctive features of housing estates, such as social structure renewal in housing estates from the 1950s and 1960s, residential ageing in those from the 1970s, and the risk of an exodus of young residents from estates from the 1980s. Those shared problems may soon become decisive for the future development of large estates.","Klíčová slova: large housing estates, neighbourhood change, socio-spatial change, mixed heterogeneous neighbourhood, post-socialist city"

This article analyses the hinterland of Bratislava from various perspectives of suburban development. The selection of variables covers the origin of in-migrants and their economic activity, education, and family status. Indicators of land use, housing construction, and property prices supplement these data. The data are processed based on a factorial ecology approach, which tries to discover the basic dimensions of the socio-spatial structure, and cluster analysis. Using these methods the authors identify similar clusters and categorise individual municipalities into relatively homogeneous units-suburban development types. The results lead to a number of very interesting findings. The same types of suburban municipalities are not arranged in concentric zones, which means that the factor of distance from the city does not play a prominent role. The prevailing factor is the sectorial structure, which reflects the different levels of attractiveness municipalities hold for different socio-economic groups of in-migrants. This article seeks to identify key factors that affect the formation of individual suburban zones and thus contributes to a better understanding of the processes that decisively shape the socio-spatial organisation of hinterlands in post-socialist cities today.","Klíčová slova: suburban development, socio-spatial differentiation, regional typology, Bratislava, Slovakia"

It does not conceive space as a dimensionless, empty, and homogeneous container but draws instead on the concept of place as unique and meaningful. The conceptualisation of place is thus based on the classic works of the humanist geographers Yi-Fu Tuan and Edward Relph, who consider place to be integral, enclosed, and determinable. The issue of the determinability of integral and still meaningful place is examined using Michel Foucault's concept of heterotopia. A certain place in a city is linked to a number of other places, which in a way then become present in that place. The place cannot be considered a homotopia but, on the contrary, is a heterotopia. Place can also be conceived from a temporal point of view. Various times (rhythms) blend in a place and they refer to processes that were taking place in other (even temporally very remote) times. Similarly, just as place can be spatially considered a heterotopia, temporally it may be considered a heterochronia. The term heterochronotopia is used to refer to a place that opens out both spatially to other places and temporally to other times. Empirically the article focuses on one selected place in the post-socialist and post-industrial city of Brno (Czech Republic). The article seeks to (1) identify links connecting the researched place to other sites and times and to (2) describe the selected place as a system of associations. The research combines a very wide range of methods such as direct observation, informal interviews, and analyses of historical documents, photos, public transport timetables, etc. The article thus offers an example of a dense description of a place as a temporally or spatially undeterminable entity, provides material for critical reflection on the assumption that urban place is enclosed and determinable, and introduces 'heterochronotopia' as a new concept referring to a spatially and temporally undetermined place in a contemporary city.","Klíčová slova: place, heterotopia, heterochronia, heterochronotopia, Brno"

Qualitative analysis of three inner-city flagship projects-creative campus, museum, and cultural hub-revealed that culture-led regeneration projects, whether public or private initiatives, are regarded as standard business models. In terms of their influence on local communities, the projects vary depending on their focus, the degree of engagement of local groups in the planning phase and activities, and the extent of actual physical change. However, in cases where local groups have been engaged, the engagement has been selective and has primarily involved the creative class.

However, in 2012, the previous scholarly consensus concerning the classification of the Czech Republic dissolved, and 'post-Duvergerian' scholars now regard the Czech regime as semi-presidential. The article works with the original Duvergerian definition into which it introduces the new concept of semi-presidentialism, which is based on presidential powers. The article applies this new concept to the Czech regime for the period since the first directly elected president, Miloš Zeman, took office. Enjoying a legitimacy advantage, Zeman broke with the constitutional conventions that had hitherto been followed and appointed a cabinet headed by Jiří Rusnok without consulting with the parliamentary parties and in opposition to their original opinion. This attempt to change Czech parliamentary practice nevertheless failed: the Rusnok cabinet lost the vote of confidence in parliament and further attempts by Zeman to shift constitutional practice in favour of the Office of the President and to acquire greater influence over the Executive were unsuccessful. The Czech political regime should therefore still be classified as a parliamentary regime.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, democratic regime, semi-presidentialism, president"

Drawing on Sani and Sartori's concept of party competition, it incorporates later findings on the nature of party competition to facilitate the concept's application to fluid party systems. It conceptualises party competition as multi-dimensional and according to the (a) salience the individual dimensions used in this analysis have for political parties and (b) the positions that the parties occupy on these dimensions. It distinguishes three types of relations in party competition - non-competitive, defensive and acquisitive competition - and using data from the Chapel Hill questionnaire survey focuses on three dimensions in Czech party competition: socio-economic, European, and social-liberal/conservative. Special attention is devoted to the competition strategies of individual parties while taking into account the duration of their existence (new vs traditional parties). The findings indicate that the nature of party competition has transformed, as changes have occurred in the intensity of the competition, the salience of the dimensions of the competition, the space of the competition, and how much competition occurs in one dimensions as opposed to another. Consistent with previous studies, the analyses reveal, that most of the competitive relationships (which were primarily defensive in nature) observed in this study occurred in the socioeconomic dimension, but they also show that there is very strong potential for intense party competition to develop in the other two dimensions if they become more salient.","Klíčová slova: party competition, policy space, elections"

The article describes the findings from a study examining the degree to which socio-economic legislative promises were fulfilled by the second government of Mirek Topolánek, the first government of Petr Nečas, and the (recent) government of Bohuslav Sobotka after a year and a half for all governments, and in the end of the term for Topolánek's and Nečas' governments. Coalition parties were found to have fulfilled 19-40% of their election promises after a year and a half in office, and this percentage had only increased slightly by the time the two governments that were studied for the full duration of their time in office had reached the end of their term. Binary logistic regression models revealed that the odds of election promises being fulfilled are greater if a promise is formulated as a commitment to maintain the status quo and if a promise is consensual and included in a coalition agreement. By contrast, there was no effect observed to result from party control of government ministries or from the advantage of being the prime ministerial party.","Klíčová slova: party mandate model, promise/pledge fulfilment, coalition parties, Czech Republic"

It analyses daily interactions between the majority population and Vietnamese immigrants in one Prague neighbourhood in an effort to identify both tensions and conflicts and conviviality in everyday life, while distinguishing between the stereotypes prevalent in popular discourse and in representations of the Vietnamese and the real practices of economic, social, and cultural interaction. The study seeks to identify the issues and places around which tensions emerge and where everyday conviviality is negotiated and the attitudes that various demographic and socio-economic groups of the local population have towards the Vietnamese presence in the area. The Vietnamese seek to avoid conflict, yet they often report feeling they are not very accepted by the majority population. There is a hidden racism that exists in the attitudes of the majority population to Vietnamese immigrants. However, the paper also documents instances of convivial everyday interactions. While the interactions are characterised by a certain lack of mutual recognition, they do not lead to serious interethnic tensions and conflicts.","Klíčová slova: migrant integration, social interaction, conflict, everyday conviviality, multiethnic neighbourhood"

Cross-sectional data in the Czech Republic consistently present evidence of job insecurity and employment vulnerability in older age groups. Aggregated data and statistical indices do not, however, offer a sufficiently detailed picture of the social processes (e.g. exit from the labour market, duration of unemployment, and exit from unemployment) behind the numbers. This article takes a dynamic look at the position of older workers in the labour market by investigating transitions between employment and unemployment using a sub-sample of older workers (50 year and over) from the Czech EU-SILC, who were interviewed repeatedly in a panel survey between 2004 and 2009. The authors use survival analysis methods to study the time-dependence of transitions into and out of unemployment and both with and without covariates. The results suggest that older workers are not at a higher risk of exiting the labour market (compared to other age groups), but once they are unemployed, their odds of getting back into employment are significantly lower. Even when controls (such as education level) are included in the model this disadvantage persists. Interestingly, while education generally protects people from labour market exit, this protective effect is weaker among older workers.","Klíčová slova: employment, unemployment, older workers, survival analysis, Czech Republic"

Unlike most sociological papers, its target is the locally situated sporting subculture, only partly professionalised and medialised, examined in the example of a top-level swimming club in Brno. It draws on Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic capital to present a case study of a specific sporting sub-culture based on qualitative methods, most notably in-depth interviews, unobtrusive observation, and document analysis. The sports star is here envisioned as the product of an accumulation of the sporting capital of members of a sporting club, the basic factors of which are the various types of capital the swimmers possess (social, cultural, physical, or material) and, especially, the degree to which the particular types of capital are accepted and acknowledged by other members of the swimming club. Two types of swimming star are identified. The authentic star is a successful athlete who respects the values and norms of the top-level club. By contrast, the inauthentic star ignores some of the values or disrupts the relative autonomy of the swimming sport by becoming overly involved with the mass media. The swimmers' relationship with the media emerges as crucial; how much they object to or benefit from the influence of the media defines the authenticity of the swimmers' status in the swimming club.","Klíčová slova: sport stars, sporting fi eld, symbolic capital, top-level sports, swimming"

It shows that although the concept of gender is implicitly embedded in the social phenomenon of divorce, the majority of empirical research on divorce conceptualises gender only as differences in the behaviour of men and women. This approach can be useful for explaining the gender structure of the causes and consequences of divorce. Here more attention is given to studies that explicitly mention the concept of gender at the structural, institutional, and interactional levels. It reviews the literature on gender as part of the institutional environment, and in this context it introduces the perspectives on changing gender roles as a factor influencing divorce and the literature mapping the potential of divorce to change the gender order of society. These theoretical perspectives are relatively rare in the divorce literature; therefore, it is useful to provide Czech readers with a review of some inspiring conceptualisations and put them in the context of knowledge about divorce in the Czech Republic.","Klíčová slova: divorce, gender, divorce consequences, gender roles, sociology of the family"

Moreover, it is argued that the effect of multi-level incumbency can be well observed even in proportional electoral systems. Empirically, the impact of incumbency on a candidate's chances to succeed in the recruitment process and to obtain preferential votes is analysed using regional assembly elections in the Czech Republic as an example.

They formulate six hypotheses to account for the effects of social variables (year, sex, age, education, and marital status) on suicide rates, which they test using data from 1995 to 2010. Their findings show that time weakens the odds for committing suicides. Regardless of the time, women and people who are young, more educated, and living in a marriage face the lowest risk of suicide. That marriage works as a shield against suicide is especially true for men (its protective function for women is significantly lower). In the period observed, there was a relative increase in the effect of two social variables: middle age (45-69 years) and lower education. The structure of variables explaining suicide rates changed during the time period observed.","Klíčová slova: suicide, suicide rate, social factors, Czech society, time period, 1995-2010"

A total of 2229 academics (men = 57.1%) completed a survey measuring their job satisfaction, job stress, and work environment perceptions. Findings revealed high levels of overall job satisfaction (83.6% satisfied with their jobs) and relatively low levels of stress (13.7% regularly stressed). Most academics reported positive features of their work environment including autonomy and quality, role clarity, influence over academic work, and a strong social community. Negative features included dissatisfaction with pay, poor leadership, and pressure to produce. Job satisfaction was significantly associated with traditional academic values (focus on quality, involvement in decision-making, commitment to the workplace, recognition), while stress was linked to market-related aspects (pressure to produce, quantitative work demands, job insecurity). The study highlighted relatively high levels of well-being among Czech faculty, which can be attributed to the continued prevalence of a traditional, professor-oriented academic system based on autonomy and collegiality. Despite recent market-oriented changes within Czech research policy, the negative effects of marketisation are not yet pronounced in the quality of academic worklife in public universities, except for the increasing pressure for productivity.","Klíčová slova: quality of worklife, academic staff, job satisfaction, job stress, marketisation, professor-oriented system, higher education"

Using data from the Czech contribution to the EU-SILC survey, it tests hypotheses concerning the difference between the current situation of adults who grew up in single-parent families and those who were raised in intact families. We look for the influence of socialisation on single-parent families in three areas-educational attainment, current partnership situation, and current family income. The results of regression analyses show that the differences between children from single-parent families and those from intact ones are very small in the area of education (the influence is apparent only at the secondary school graduation level, no difference is present at the tertiary education level), relatively weak in the area of partnership situation, and imperceptible from the viewpoint of family income. These results exclude a causal explanation for the influence of single-parent families on outcomes, cast doubt on selective principles, and open space for interpretation in terms of mechanisms of family de-institutionalisation.","Klíčová slova: single-parent families, divorce, social reproduction, Czech Republic"

Although this phenomenon is widely studied abroad, there are only a handful of Czech studies that discuss it in depth. The aim of this article is to broaden the scope of research in this area. The article maps the possible causes and consequences of fear of crime in reference to the literature and the specific milieu of the Czech Republic. The author draws on a representative sample of 2836 respondents from the fifth wave of the European Social Survey. Consistent with findings in international research the data suggest that a perceived risk of victimisation is a significant factor influencing respondents' fear. Conversely, indicators of vulnerability, such as gender and satisfaction with family income or victimisation, although statistically significant, explain only a small part of the variability of the dependent variable. Rather they act vicariously right through the perceived risk of victimisation. Finally, the data suggest that fear of crime can play an important role in shaping attitudes towards different social institutions, in particular the police. A higher fear of crime correlates with/is associated with a worse assessment of police effectiveness.","Klíčová slova: fear of crime, perceived risk of victimisation, police effectiveness, European Social Survey Round 5"

The authors set out from the assumption that ethnic homogamy is an indicator of the degree of ethnic tolerance and multiculturalism in society. Greater ethnic homogamy indicates larger social distances between ethnic groups, and vice versa. The authors analyse data from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic. The data include all marriages between 1992 and 2012 in Slovakia categorised by the ethnicity of the spouses. The authors test hypotheses about the trends in both absolute and relative ethnic homogamy and find that marriages in Slovakia are strongly structured by ethnic homogamy. The probability of ethnically heterogamous marriage varies among ethnic groups; however, it does not increase for any of the ethnic groups over the period of analysis. Members of different ethnic groups have not grown socially closer and interethnic distances have not decreased due to marriage.","Klíčová slova: ethnic inequality, ethnic exclusion, conflict, Slovakia"

The paper has three main goals: (1) a theoretical conceptualisation of welfare surveillance based on an analysis of existing empirical research; (2) an analysis of socio-practical manifestations and impacts of welfare surveillance; and (3) a contextualisation of the implementation of welfare surveillance within the Czech social milieu during recent social reforms. Within the scope of the first two goals, the author shows that welfare surveillance is theoretically construed along the lines of a specific combination of social justice and neoliberal governmentality, and that welfare surveillance enables the application of specific illiberal practices to welfare applicants and recipients in order to effectively discipline and normalise them, which results in the stigmatisation and criminalisation of recipients. Given that there is relatively little research on surveillance in the Czech Republic, the article opens with an introduction to the issue of surveillance.","Klíčová slova: CDA, Czech Republic, illiberal practices, neoliberal governmentality, semi-structured interviews, social deviation, stigmatisation, welfare surveillance"

Through a case study of a Local Action Group (LAG), the paper traces the construction of rurality and the ways in which rurality is employed as an identity tool and a market commodity. The study is grounded in a constructivist approach in rural sociology, emphasising the multiplicity of meanings ascribed to the rural by stakeholders. The study highlights the identity politics produced by rural development programmes and the implications these have for defining regional borders and for the very notion of 'rurality'. Commodification gives rise to a sphere of cultural economics, whereby the past and natural and cultural heritage are sold on the market. The establishment of a certified brand of regional products is an important tool of cultural economics. Two layers of identity are traced in the study of this process (and of the activities of the LAG in general). The paper argues that the tension between the layers of marketised identity and quasi-natural identity reflects the tension between professional and lay discourses of rurality.","Klíčová slova: rurality, commodification, regional identity, cultural economy, LAG, LEADER"

It begins by defining the institutional context of adult education in the country. Three institutional characteristics are of particular interest in this respect: returns to education, the current level of education of the adult population (and the related demand for adult education), and institutions offering adult education. Using the LFS and AES surveys, the authors find that it is primarily young and educated persons who pursue adult education. With respect to the returns to adult education, the results show that adult education does not protect against downward mobility but does increase the odds of upward mobility. The positive effect of adult education on upward mobility is more pronounced among women than men.","Klíčová slova: adult education, participation in education, occupational prestige, survival analysis, Czech Republic"

She analyses data from a qualitative empirical study in order to understand how various aspects of poverty in old age and the status of being poor impact seniors' performance of social roles. The author approaches poverty and old age as stigmas and looks at the ways in which seniors living in poverty defend their identity against inferior status. The article explains how the role of a poor senior is performed, whether and how poverty affects the roles that poor seniors share with other seniors, and whether the ascriptive status of old age or the objectively low social status of poverty is more significant for the performance of their role. Drawing on the results of her analysis the author describes poverty as the 'master status': poverty is an undesirable status for seniors and strategies for defending their identity against the stigma of poverty pushes the strategies of defence against the stigma of old age into the background. The author argues that setting old age in the context of poverty reveals the limitations of some theories in the fi eld socio-gerontology.","Klíčová slova: old age, poverty, social status, master status, social roles"

She also seeks to determine in what contexts and what directions these intersections occur and what kind of integrative or exclusionary effects ethnicity has in the classroom. She argues that ethnicity primarily becomes visible during ritualised symbolic performances in which the significance of different identities is accentuated. Against the backdrop of an ethnographic description of the role of ethnicity in the classroom she analyses the position in the classroom of Roma students, whose distinctiveness can serve as a source of exclusion or a means for selfassertion. At the intersection of the low status that Roma students are given in their role as students and the high status in their role as friends, ethnicity and ethnicisations in the classroom are to be contradictory in their effects.","Klíčová slova: ethnicity, interaction rituals, ethnography, peer relations, intersections of identities, school"

The reliability estimates were obtained using the Quasi Simplex Model (QSM), which has never before been used in Czech research. An analysis was carried out on all the items in the EU-SILC questionnaire that fulfilled the criteria for the QSM analysis: PH010, the item that asks respondents about their subjective health, HS120, the item that asks about the household's financial situation, and HS130, which asks what the minimum sufficient income of a household is. The analysis drew on all available data from Czech EU-SILC surveys, that is, data from five rotating panel surveys carried out between 2005 and 2012. The QSM analysis showed that for the selected items EU-SILC data are highly reliable; the estimated reliability of each item was around 0.8, for HS130 it was even above 0.9. The steadiness of the results was confirmed by the high consistency of the reliability estimates across all the panels. A small difference was observed between the reliability of data collected using the PAPI mode and data collected using CAPI. Given the attributes of the QSM model, however, it was impossible to test statistically whether the reliability of PAPI and CAPI data differ significantly.","Klíčová slova: quantitative data, reliability, structural equation modelling, Quasi simplex model, EU-SILC"

The case of elderly care presents an opportunity to critically examine the concepts of the 'third age' and 'young old', that have figured prominently in theoretical and political debates concerning the life stage in which the need to care for one´s parents seems most likely to arise. In the 'collective story' based on the narratives of women aged 50-66 who provided everyday care for their elderly mother, I identify and describe the factors that influence how this stage in life unfolds and the decisions women make about their life/life course. I argue that in contemporary Czech society 'young old age' cannot be defined in terms of the absence of work commitments or the absence family care commitments, and that the original concepts dealing with this new period in life did not take the new commitments of care or the gendered aspect of them into consideration.","Klíčová slova: elderly care, third age, young old, informal care, ageing"

This article studies whether and why care by grandmothers and grandfathers is influenced by their family arrangement. Following previous research, the authors focus on the mediating role of grandmothers in the involvement of men in caring for their grandchildren. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data about grandparents with small grandchildren (under ten years of age). The quantitative analysis is based on SHARE data and identifies whether the involvement in care depends on gender and the partnership arrangements of grandparents, controlling for a number of other characteristics of families. The analysis reveals a strong positive impact of the presence of a partner on the engagement of men (but not women) in grandparental care. This effect is present among both intact families and families with more complex arrangements. The qualitative analysis of 20 interviews with mothers and 20 interviews with grandmothers provides a deeper understanding of these results. It shows that the involvement of grandparents is shaped by the gender-specific notions of care competence and grandparental roles held by the participants and also by the kin-keeping activities of women. Grandmothers, compared to their male counterparts, are perceived as more capable of satisfying the needs of a small child. They also do more work on maintaining intergenerational family relationships and arranging care. They actively (sometimes in very sophisticated ways) involve their partners in the care of grandchildren.","Klíčová slova: care, gender, grandparents, kin-keeping, partnership situation"

Seen in the context of the dominant scholarship, this is a quite unique case in the field of care work where the employers are immigrants, while the employees are women of the host country. Drawing upon fifteen in-depth interviews with Czech nannies, this article analyses the motivations to become a nanny in a Vietnamese family. It employs the perspective of the life course in order to understand what changes in women's biographies lie behind these decisions. The author focuses on the transitions in nannies' life cycles at the crossroads of three aspects of their biographies: the family caregiving role, position in the labour market and the welfare state, and the meaning of paid caregiving. By looking at how women experience and attach meaning to transitions and phases in their life, which lead them to take a gendered job as a nanny, the author sheds light on the dynamics of the complex processes (taking place in families, the labour market, or the welfare state) that constitute these changes. This article-through the analysis of the motivations to become nannies-illuminates the broader issues of how gendered biographies are shaped under particular socio-economic and historical conditions, as well as by particular cultural expectations of caregiving.","Klíčová slova: caregiving, life course, gender, nanny, Vietnamese immigrants, caring biographies"

Based on data from 16 biographical interviews with partners living in separate households, this analysis focuses on how LAT is experienced, understood, and explained in the context of the post-state-socialist Czech Republic. Do LAT partners actively choose LAT to avoid or subvert the norm of co-residence? Or do they frame their situation as a result of external constraints and pressures? What is the role of gender norms and of the gendering of a life course in the LAT experience? Our results show the high value that current Czech society continues to place on co-residential partnerships. The study also shows that persistent gender and social inequalities, specific for the post state-socialist Czech Republic, make individual choices more difficult or impossible in both private life arrangements and when combining private life with work. A LAT partnership is not always the result of individual choices, but the relationship often is shaped by external structural and institutional pressures and gendered norms.","Klíčová slova: living apart together, biographical research, post-socialist, gender norm, co-residential partnership"

Although we found an overall gender disadvantage in re-partnering across all countries, in more traditional contexts, parenthood undermines the chances of re-partnering for women but not for men. The negative effect of older age for re-partnering after divorce is almost universal for men, but is context-sensitive for women. Education does not affect women's chances of re-partnering, but it does play a significant role in the attractiveness of men in more traditional settings. The analysis is based on the partnership and parenthood histories recorded in the Generations and Gender Survey.","Klíčová slova: re-partnering, divorce, gender culture, Central European countries, Baltic countries"

There are two main aims of this study. First it seeks to reveal whether any specific features appear when (temporarily) childless people are compared with those having children in the same cohorts. It also aims to explore what kinds of factors can lead to childlessness (or more precisely, the prolongation of a childless period in life) among those men and women who, according to their self-assessment, were not prevented from having children by their own or their partner's health constraints. The analysis draws on GGS data from the first three waves of the Hungarian panel survey 'Turning Points of the Life Course' conducted in 2001, 2004, and 2008. The focus is on men and women who were childless in 2001 and were still childless in 2008. According to the findings, events directly connected to childbearing, such as having a stable partner or not having a partner, living in cohabitation or in marriage, have more influence on decisions about becoming parents than normative expectations, while economic factors (such as having a job) have some impact mainly on postponing childbearing, but do not seem to influence directly whether people will remain childless.","Klíčová slova: postponers, childfree articulators, childless due to reproductive health problems Hungary, Generations and Gender Survey"

Of particular interest is what these narratives imply for an understanding of the state-socialist gender order. The analysis combines quantitative (the frequency of word co-occurrences) and qualitative (a hermeneutic reading of text fragments) approaches. The results provide evidence that empirically supports what has previously been suggested in the literature: there was an interdependence of private and public spheres, with the family sphere differing in importance for women and men. Additionally, the discursive density and arrangement of these spheres in the life stories differs according to sociopolitical groups, and a third sphere, which we have labelled 'politics', emerges for some groups. The findings reveal insights into the relationship between the gender order and the life course through a narrative articulation of life stories of different social groups in Czech state-socialist society.","Klíčová slova: life-course narratives, oral history, gender order, Czech Republic, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, socio-political groups"

Based on interviews that were carried out with 20 mothers and 20 grandmothers of children under the age of 10, the article analyses what kinds of expectations are attached to the role of grandmother and how the norm of 'good' grandmother is constructed by different generations of women. The author identifies three strong norms of grandmothering: the norm of non-interference, the norm of constant availability, and the norm of activity. The narratives of both the mothers and the grandmothers reflected a strong 'gendered contact' between the two generations, which is based on a generational transfer of caring responsibilities. A new norm, the norm of activity, is mainly constructed by mothers and it involves the idea that a 'good' grandmother provides not just instrumental care but above all 'adventures'. Both the mothers and the grandmothers pointed out how the family role of grandmothers had changed compared to past generations of grandmothers. The article analyses the (changing) norms of grandmothering in relation to the changing cultural representation of ageing and especially in relation to ideas about active ageing, and it highlights some of the contradictory expectations that are attached to the role of grandmothers as a result of the inconsistent/clashing demands being made of them.","Klíčová slova: care, family, grandmothers, grandparents, intergenerational solidarity"

This article examines grandparenting as an emerging role of young olds in the context of their heterogeneous role sets. Based on an integrated analysis of a survey conducted among people aged 50-70 and qualitative interviews it describes what roles Czech young olds hold and how they position and frame the grandparenting role among their other individual roles. It also describes what activities the performance of the role typically involves. Attention is also devoted to gender differences, which are manifested in the meanings ascribed to the role, and in the type, frequency, and intensity of activities performed. A key issue is found to be the timing of the grandparenting role, when a period of intensive care may be followed by a performative void. From the perspective of gender structure, however, these are asynchronous changes, which makes it possible for a couple to perform their roles in a complementary manner. As some young olds pursue self-development activities indicative of active ageing with and through their grandchildren, alongside the possible duality of active ageing (as a semi-public, socially productive effort) versus grandparenting, it is possible to speak of active ageing through grandparenting, and of grandparenting as a form of active ageing.","Klíčová slova: grandparenting, social role, active ageing, role overload, performative void"

However, divorced grandparents and grandfathers in particular are less likely to provide care for their grandchildren. This article examines the reasons for this. Drawing on the literature on this subject, the authors first argue that divorced grandfathers are less likely than their married counterparts both to provide care and to provide care often. This may be because compared to married grandfathers they tend to: (1) have a larger number of children and grandchildren (because they often repartner after divorce); (2) live farther away from their offspring; (3) have less frequent contact with their offspring; and (4) be in poorer health. Using Czech SHARE (Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe) data from waves two and four, the authors show that divorced grandfathers in the Czech Republic are less likely to care for their grandchildren and provide frequent care primarily owing to the fact that they have less frequent contact with their children. The authors found no support for the assumption that the negative effect of divorce can be explained by the number of children or grandchildren divorced grandparents have, by their geographical distance from offspring or by their subjective health.","Klíčová slova: grandchild care provision, grandparenthood, grandfathers, divorce"

The nannies are usually recently retired women who welcome the opportunity for daily (paid) activity. Close daily contact between a nanny and a child leads to the formation of kinship ties: the nanny becomes the child's grandmother, and the cared-for child becomes the nanny's grandchild. Drawing on in-depth interviews the author examines these intergenerational relationships and focuses on how the nannies and the children understand these relationships in the context of their biographies. To this end the author poses two questions: How does the kinning process between nanny and child occur? What is the meaning of the established kinship ties for the Czech grandmothers and their Vietnamese grandchildren? The main argumentation is based on the assumption that children need grandmothers and women need to be grandmothers. The author argues that both of these needs are fulfilled in the daily practice of caregiving and thereby in the formation of strong emotional ties that in many respects override the biogenetic ties. In this particular case study, paid caregiving is found to give rise to new kinds of kinship relations and to enable women and children to be active parts of an intergenerational relationship. The unique case of ties between migrant families and Czech/native-born women also serves as a potential way of reconceptualising grandparenthood, grandchildhood, and intergenerational relationships.","Klíčová slova: grandparethood, grandchildhood, caregiving, kinning"

Research to date has focused primarily on this issue in reference to multi-year gymnasia. This article concentrates on variation at the primary-school level, on which there are only limited empirical data available on the distribution of students. It looks at how important the choice of primary school by parents of preschool-age children is, how that choice is realized over time, and what parental characteristics influence their choice of school. The answers to these questions are obtained from an analysis of data from a questionnaire survey conducted in 2014 amongst a representative sample of 2008 parents of preschool-age children. The authors employ a logistic regression analysis and compare data for 2014 with data obtained in 2009 in a survey of parents with children who were of compulsory school age. These analyses reveal that there is currently universal support amongst parents for the right to choose between schools. The possibility to choose puts at an advantage those children whose parents have at least upper secondary education and live in large towns, who are able to effectively obtain information on the quality of schools, the potential effect of which is to reinforce existing educational inequalities.","Klíčová slova: school choice, primary school, tracking, family background"

These issues are examined from the viewpoint that various conditions force even public education to be guided by certain principles of the free market (e.g. competing for clients), although its actions in this respect are simultaneously rather constrained. The article sets out to analyse the primary education market in a model region Turnov (situated in Czechia) in relation to the type of catchment area. It discusses the pitfalls of public school marketisation, and it analyses the spatial distribution of schools in the model region and the schools' jurisdictions based on the different types of catchment areas, which are defined and created in the form of cartographic visualisation. The article also examines four municipalities with small rural school as case studies selected on the basis of representing different types of catchment area. The authors discuss the findings of in-depth interviews that were conducted with headmasters, school operators, and some parents in the four municipalities in order to identify the strategies that schools can use to strengthen their position in the primary education market. The authors find that not only do schools' marketing strategies vary little depending on their geographical location but the majority of schools in the case study have not formulated a unique and systematic vision and mission for their school. The principal features of all the schools studied are their self-identification in opposition to the culture of urban schools.","Klíčová slova: primary schools, rural space, marketisation, catchment area, Czechia, Turnov region"

A related question, and one with policy relevance, concerns the role of education in women's deep-rooted preferences and individual concepts of life-success. A third question is to what extent higher education helps women to overcome social barriers to implementing their choices between job (career) and family (household), barriers that mainly derive from the prevalence of conservative values and low labour-market flexibility. The authors carried out a comparative analysis of 25 European countries using data from the second round of the European Social Survey (ESS2) collected in the year 2004. The results of multilevel modeling reveal that education not only significantly reduces the tendency towards conservative values and strengthens openness to change - more significantly with women than with men - but simultaneously helps women overcome the social barriers in the formation of their work-career preferences, particularly in countries with stronger barriers.","Klíčová slova: values, education, gender, modernisation, preference theory, work orientations"

Given the multi-mediated nature of contemporary moral panics and in contrast to conventional analysis focusing on newspaper coverage this article is based on Polish migrants' self-reported experiences. Moral panic claims making about Polish workers 'taking British jobs' and 'abusing British social benefits' are perceived by the respondents themselves. Our analysis is in line with Sean Hier's conceptualisations of the interplay between individualised risk management and moral panic claims-making, which are manifestations of conflictual sites of the contemporary neo-liberal project of prudentialism. The article argues that the anti-Polish migrant campaign in Britain after 2004, which dramatised Polish migrants as 'stealing the jobs' of the native population, cannot be properly analysed as an irrational ethnic bias or an elite-engineering panic but is rather an expression of the destabilising effects of employment insecurities within Western risk societies.","Klíčová slova: Polish migrants, moral panic, employment insecurities, moral regulations"

The authors look at Czech discourse from the perspective of the wider discussion about the role that the notion of class plays in post-communist societies. While some researchers argue that social class is absent as a category within post-communist political discourse, other researchers report the existence of derogatory discourse on the lower classes and even consistent symbolic boundaries between classes. This analysis contributes to the discussion by offering recent evidence of both the rejection and the use of class-based classification in the discourse. The authors argue that the rejection of the notion of class goes hand in hand with the symbolic division of society into class-like groups. They illustrate how these divisions are tied to the idea of a legitimate political subjectivity and conclude by noting similarities to contemporary 'Western' discourse on social class.","Klíčová slova: social class, inequality, political discourse, post-socialism, Czech society"

Das, Hermann Strasser",1 Concordia College-New York;2 University of Duisburg-Essen,"This paper examines the life and career of the prominent sociologist Werner Stark (1909-1985), born and raised in Marienbad, Bohemia, and after 1918 in the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia. As a prolific and wide-ranging scholar whose many works failed to find an enduring place in American sociology, Stark is a prime example of academic marginalisation. The authors analyse Stark's major contributions from the standpoint of the sociology of knowledge. They argue that his ideas regarding human nature, the need for social discipline, and the desirability of community were rooted in a pervasive biographical marginality that found resolution in his conversion to Catholicism. In turn, these ideas reinforced the marginality from which they emerged. The reception of Stark's work in the United States was governed by a perceived incompatibility of his outlook with the assumptions and goals of his American audience. In particular, Stark offered an explicitly value-directed sociology, one which asserted the importance of social order, individual discipline, and universal community, at a time (the 1960s and 1970s) when the field sought to maintain its credibility as an objective scientific discipline in the face of growing challenges from sociologists and non-sociologists alike. Stark's American colleagues focused on aspects of his work that were incompatible with their own cultural and disciplinary orientations and this obscured the full range of his achievements, especially his analyses which anticipated contemporary sociological work.","Klíčová slova: Werner Stark, marginalisation, religion, culture, social bond, values, sociology of knowledge, Catholicism"

This problem, however, has been peripheralised since the decline of functionalism, while legitimation and regulation/power-differentials have moved to the forefront. This article argues that by reconceptualising the concept, generalised symbolic media, a robust theory of integration can be posited that does not sacrifice the importance of regulation (control) or legitimation (meaning). This paper extends both the Simmelian and functionalist versions of media by: (1) precisely defining the concept; (2) examining its two forms-a specialised institutional language and as an external referent of value; (3) elucidating the three modes of orientation various media impose; and (4) extending the function of media beyond (social) exchange to include other institutional processes such as communicative action, performance, and ritualised interaction. Ultimately, a reconceptualised theory of generalised symbolic media offers sociology a mechanism that simultaneously highlights the diversity found across institutional spheres, as well as the limits humans have in dealing with the problems posed by differentiation.","Klíčová slova: generalised symbolic media, institutions, integration, emotions, cultural sociology, morality"

Social support networks in this study were created using the multiple name generator method. Here the generator was made up of six questions asking whom respondents might turn to for money, employment, housing, leisure, to discuss intimate things, or might simply be important to the respondent in some other way. Data-collecting was conducted in Pilsen, an industrial city with a large number of immigrants, and data were obtained from 30 Ukrainians. The networks were measured using structural measures (density, degree centrality and betweenness centrality) as well as common egocentric ones (multiplexity, frequency etc.). The analysis revealed that networks of Ukrainians are not very dense and consist mainly of friends. Friends are important in matters concerning housing, employment, and leisure. By contrast, family is important in more extraordinary situations - for instance, in a financial emergency or to discuss crucial issues. There is also a significant difference between the networks of manual and non-manual workers: manual workers are likely to associate with peers also working in manual labour and their networks are denser than the networks of non-manual workers. In Pilsen, Ukrainians do not form locality-based ethnic communities, and in a long-term perspective their personal networks indicate gradual social integration to the Czech society.","Klíčová slova: personal networks, social support networks, structural analysis, SNA, community, Ukrainians, Czech Republic, social integration."

Moreover, voter turnout and the share of invalid votes decrease substantially between the first and the second rounds of the Senate elections. This article enquires into the causes of the decrease. It builds on theories that emphasise the salience of elections and the decisiveness of voting and using data from all Senate electoral races between 1996 and 2012 tests several theoretical predictions drawn from these theories. Two types of regression models are employed to test these hypotheses. Surprisingly, the findings show that neither the closeness of the electoral race nor the presence of an incumbent or a communist candidate has an influence on voter turnout. The decrease in turnout between rounds and between electoral cycles is best explained by the fact that first-round elections coincide with other types of elections, and by the lack of ideologically polarised electoral races in the second rounds and the fragmentation of the first round contest. The substantial number of invalid votes in the fi rst rounds can be attributed to voting error rather than deliberate electoral behaviour. The article closes with several suggestions regarding the electoral system used in the Czech Senate elections and with a discussion of the implications of the findings for current research.","Klíčová slova: voter turnout, invalid ballots, Czech Republic, Senate elections, electoral systems"

It examines the extent to which married and cohabiting couples differ with respect to money pooling and whether the observed differences can be attributed to the socio-demographic composition of married and unmarried couples or different value orientations. The empirical part uses a sequential logistic analysis. First, the odds of pooling (versus non-pooling) are explored; second, the odds of using fully independent money management (versus partial pooling) are estimated. The results show that cohabiting couples are more likely not to pool money and are more likely to keep their money completely separate. Although the socio-demographic composition of the couples explains some of the differences, it does not account fully for all the differences observed. Even if the socio-demographic and value differences are controlled cohabiting couples are still more than twice as likely not to pool their money.","Klíčová slova: income management, pooling, marriage, cohabitation, ISSP 2012"

Nešpor,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i, Praha","There is a forgotten chapter in (history of) the Czech sociology of work. In the early 1940s, an empirical study was conducted by Otakar Machotka among employees of the Bata company in Batov (today Otrokovice). One of the leading figures of early Czech sociology, Machotka saw the closure of Czech universities during the Second World War as an opportunity to carry out original empirical research devoted to the sociological analysis of the workforce and consisting of a study of the social determination of work efficiency. This was the first Czech, and one of only a very few European, empirically-grounded research projects in the sociology of work and occupation that had been conducted to that time. Machotka statistically analysed the vast data sets collected by the company's personnel department and provided a detailed interpretation of the outcomes, while remaining very much aware of the limitations of the results and the methods employed. He formulated hypotheses about how the age gap between spouses, the number of children in family, and other characteristics might impact (various aspects of) work efficiency, and reformulated existing hypotheses about the impact of siblings, marital status, and parental profession. Machotka also helped to theoretically and methodologically (re)orientate the sociology of work and occupations. Machotka subsequently abandoned this topic and quantitative sociology in general, perhaps in part as a result of the above-described research, which, the author suggests, led him to realise that 'abstract empiricism' was not the only method on which to base social studies.","Klíčová slova: sociology of work, work, work qualification, sociological research, Otakar Machotka, history of Czech sociology"

In the 2000s a new spatial economic pattern established itself and the increased mobility of people into better jobs reinforced the preceding inequality in growth.

The correlations of data with particular types of regions and micro-regions are also presented, and several typical groups of micro-regions are identifi ed on the basis of analyses of changes in the population, education levels, demographic age, economic activity, and housing stock. The booming suburbia of Prague and Brno and their large hinterlands contrast with the decline of remote rural areas and regions with outdated industries such as mining, heavy industry and energy. The spatial economic disparities of the 1990s turned into spatial social polarisation, which will in turn lead to the further polarisation of regions in a future economy be based on knowledge and information. This increasing polarisation lends confirmation to theories that regional divergence is the prevailing trend in current and also future spatial change, the effects of which are contrary to the EU's objectives of territorial cohesion.","Klíčová slova: spatial convergence / divergence, spatial polarisation, metropolisation, territorial cohesion"

This article focuses on how Ukrainian physicians envision the future, present, and past of the health-care system and make sense of social change in their professional lives and society more broadly. The Ukrainian healthcare system has remained largely untouched by post-socialist reforms, but it is nevertheless undergoing profound changes. These changes are occurring on the level of everyday practice and are shifting responsibility away from the state and onto the individual. The author traces how physicians navigate the persisting structures of the old system, and what hopes they carry for the present and the future. Post-socialist health care is bursting with competing interests, commitments, and notions of how health-care providers should relate to each other, their patients, administrations, and the state in general. This article therefore draws on physicians' narratives of the disorder in health care through the interpretive prism of 'ruination … as a process that weighs on the future and shapes the present' and that represents a 'vital reconfi guration' [Stoler 2008: 194] or crafting of 'hope' [Lindquist 2006].","Klíčová slova: health care, physicians, social change, post-socialism, Ukraine"

The article presents the results of a biographical study of nurses, paying detailed attention to their emotional labour in cooperation with doctors in accident and emergency ward settings. The study draws on the concept of organisational culture in practice/action, on a Goffmanian and Garfinkelian ethnomethodology of scripts of interaction (rules, norms) in order to reconstruct the feeling rules that govern a nurse's emotional display and her role in cooperating with doctors. The article stresses the importance of emotion management as a substantial part of the gendered professional identities of health-care workers and discusses the situations when nurses' subordinate status requires a kind of stressful emotion management to keep the doctor-nurse professional relationship intact, which is not required from doctors. The study also presents a variety of coping strategies or practices normalising these morally questionable feeling rules and norms, which guide action as an integral part of the ordinary practices of the social organisation of the nurse's occupation in hospital settings.","Klíčová slova: emotion management, organisational culture, ethnomethodology, organisational norms in practice, nursing, professional roles"

Although some emigrate for long periods of time, many return after a few months or years abroad and re-enter the Czech health system. The nurses' narratives in this study draw on experiences in Czech, British, and Saudi hospitals to explore the role standardised medical policies, procedures, and protocols play in the development and maintenance of a nurse's professional identity in the post-socialist context. The author suggests that performance of protocols versus informality of practice in health-care settings provides a lens through which to view professional identity in post-socialism. In fields such as health care, standards operate as measures of security that create normative rules of governmentality, regulate behaviour, and prevent harm. The nurses in this study describe the majority of Czech hospitals as lacking standard protocols for patient care. Encountering strict rules of practice in foreign hospitals leads them to evaluate the professionalism and quality of Czech health care and their own selves as nurses. Their assessment is often based on their own ability to effectively perform within the standardised system. The author's primary analysis for this presentation will concentrate on the ways that standardisation relates to ideas about professionalism and nursing autonomy and status.","Klíčová slova: governmentality, health care, migration, post-socialism, Czech Republic"

The author argues that the principal reasons for medical travel to Poland are the lower costs of private treatment, the relatively easy access to specialised health care, and personal comfort derived from linguistic and cultural competency. The women in the study who travelled to Poland for medical treatment combined the economic resources acquired while living abroad with their knowledge of the cultural and medical system in Poland to choose the best options for them. The treatments they sought included gynaecological, dental, and other specialised treatments, for which they turned to the private health sector in Poland. Some of the women also sought treatment in other countries. The women in the study highlighted the advantages of medical travel and mobility while also reflected on the dilemmas they faced in choosing the best care. The author argues that medical travel poses a challenge to the national borders of health-care systems and the national availability of medical procedures, and found that while such mobility generates inequalities it also leads to greater agency and creativeness on the part of patients when they challenge the given regulations, authority, and expert knowledge in one country.","Klíčová slova: medical travels, migration, health-care systems, cross-border health care, Poland"

This period moreover constituted a golden age in sexology in the country. Sexual science developed as a holistic discipline, embracing achievements in medicine, psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, history, and religious studies, providing recourses for sex education and therapy. Sexuality was perceived as multidimensional and embedded in relationships, culture, economy, and society at large. This approach was fundamentally different from the biomedical model, which started to develop rapidly in the United States after Masters and Johnson's publication of Human Sexual Response in 1966. Contemporary feminist critics like Leonore Tiefer point out that Masters and Johnson's approach initiated the process of biomedicalisation and commodification of sexuality and led to the domination of pharmaceutical industries in sex therapy. Meanwhile, owing to the given political and economic context, socialist sexual science was not tied to the market and remained holistic until the advent of capitalism in the 1990s. Along with the invention of Viagra, the free market significantly reshaped the field of sex therapy, giving priority to pharmacotherapy, promoting new sexual dysfunctions, and marginalising other forms of treatment. Nevertheless, Polish sexology was not fully transformed. It proved surprisingly resilient to the influence of pharmaceutical industries and the holistic approach to sex therapy remains highly valued and often practised; pharmacotherapy is perceived as insufficient and sexual dysfunctions, including erectile dysfunctions, are frequently treated using psychotherapy, which takes into account not only psychological but also social, economic and cultural issues. This article is based on the author's ethnographic and archival research on the development of Polish sexology since the 1970s. She focuses on the relationship between sexuality, socialism, and capitalism and shows that an analysis of socialist sexology sheds light on the nature of the contemporary hegemonic understating of sexuality and sex therapy.","Klíčová slova: : history of sexology, history of sexuality, post-socialism, gender roles, Poland"

It is based on narrative interviews and a thematic analysis of them. From a description of women's birth-care experiences the author finds that women are most critical of the behaviour of health-care workers and the lack of communication provided by the system. Discussing the narrators' birth-care requirements she notes the strategies women use to attain the form of care they wished. Finally, the author observes that the women she interviewed exhibit diverse understandings of birth care, on which basis the author identifies five distinct notions of birth care that differ in three key aspects: (1) women's attitudes to medical interventions; (2) their awareness of birth care; (3) their subjectivity and position in relation to birth-care providers. These ranged from complete acceptance of the way in which birth care is provided, to notions that are critical but accepting of medicalised care, to a rejection of the medical model of birth care and the assumption of 'a responsible consumer' subjectivity. The article in particular looks at women's disillusionment with birth care and interprets it in relation to clashing ideas about the relationship between birthcare provider and user associated on one hand with the socialist past and on the other with neo-liberal discourses on health.","Klíčová slova: birth care, neo-liberalism, post-socialist, paternalism, Czech Republic"

Indexed since the 1970s, SČ/CSR is the longest-covered East European sociology journal in the Web of Science. Beyond citation counts available through the WoS's Basic Search option, foreign-journal citation data were collected by examining the reference lists of all WoS-indexed foreign-journal articles listed as citing SČ/CSR in the WoS's Cited Reference Search or Google Scholar. In total, 690 foreign-journal citations of SČ/CSR between 1965 and 2013 were retrieved, including 113 author self-citations and 253 citations made by Czech and Slovak authors. Among the 690 citations, 379 are not indexed correctly in the WoS. The number of foreign citations missing from the WoS ranges from 14% for the Czech issues in 2002-2013 to 32% for the English issues in the same period. WoS is missing all 221 citations to the Czech Sociological Review between 1993 and 2001; this was a separate journal not included in the SSCI, which resulted in an important loss of international visibility for Czech sociology. In terms of per-article-citedness by foreign journals, the fewest citations were of the journal in the period up to 1989, followed by the Czech issues in 2002-2013, and the Czech issues again in 1990-2001. The highest foreign citation numbers were received by the English-language edition in 1993-2001, followed by the English issues in 2002-2013. The author's expanded foreign citation data set yields a very different ranking of most-cited articles than the one based on WoS citation counts, suggesting that WoS is not a reliable source of data for identifying most-cited articles. A comparison between most-cited articles by any journal and by foreign journals only indicates that different articles are influential nationally and internationally.","Klíčová slova: : bibliometrics, Web of Science, Sociologický časopis, Czech Sociological Review, Czech sociology"

Neoliberální režim vědění a jeho přivlastnění postmoderního obrazu světa,Jan Balon,"Institut sociologických studií, Fakulta sociálních věd UK, Praha","This essay is about the disappearance of postmodernism from the debates on the nature of science, conditions of knowledge, targets of higher education, and prospects of interdisciplinarity. It is argued that postmodern declarations of the end of ideological battles, together with the critiques of universalising concepts related to science, knowledge, and education, have been recaptured in 'new' vocabularies promoted by neoliberal approaches. While postmodernism dismissed many of the meanings previously attached to knowledge and education, it also opened up space to expand on them in terms of their exchange value. The essay shows how neoliberal approaches attacked this space and developed a systematic conception that links knowledge and education to the rationality of the market. The 'new' vocabulary clearly expresses universalising claims, as this is evident in the usage of such concepts as the knowledge revolution, the knowledge economy, public relevance, social impact, or excellence. This essay concludes with a discussion of how these tendencies are affecting sociology and its disciplinary identity in terms of both its educational and its research activities. In general, it is claimed that the regressive effects of the neoliberal regime of knowledge on sociology cannot be avoided, as the overall academic, institutional, and material context now being constructed by the 'new' knowledge ideology does not overlap with the intellectual claims on which sociology was founded. The essay also discusses the possible dissipation of sociology within applied social studies and the changing relation of sociology and its publics.","Klíčová slova: postmodernism, neoliberalism, university, knowledge, sociology as a discipline"

The author provides a summary of all the articles, reviews, and information on the topic published in the journal and shows that, regardless of its importance within Czech sociological discourse at the various stages in the development of the discipline, the sociology of religion has generally had only a limited presence in the journal over the years, for both internal (sociologists of religion were not considered 'core members' of the sociological community) and external reasons (fear of what was considered a 'problematic' topic during the communist era and the non-existence of 'untarnished' students of religion after the collapse of the communist regime). The situation changed only recently, broadly speaking in the last decade, as younger generations seized the initiative and research on religion became a standard part of the Czech sociological mainstream. However, only a small number of contemporary sociologists of religion publish articles in the journal and, consequently, this sub-discipline is still far from being a consistent presence in its pages. The limited degree to which Czech sociology of religion has established itself in the pages of Sociologický časopis / Czech Sociological Review thus raises fundamental questions about the nature of the discipline, its students, and the broader sociological environment.","Klíčová slova: sociology of religion, Czech sociology, Sociologický časopis, Sociologický časopis / Czech Sociological Review"

One important area that criminal policy research has long dealt with is public attitudes to punishment. Statements that the public want more severe punishments for those who break the law are often used to justify introducing measures to make the criminal justice system harsher. There are, however, different ways to measure public opinion on criminal sentencing. While general attitudinal questions indicate the public to be very punitive in outlook, when they have to evaluate specific cases the results are slightly more positive. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey, the article aims to describe the current level of punitiveness in the Czech Republic, as measured by both above-mentioned indicators, and to assess whether the respondents' answers to such indicators are influenced by the same factors. Data show that Czechs tend to have relatively strong punitive attitudes. However, past studies have shown that people are less punitively inclined when they are judging a specific case. Moreover, regression analysis suggests that, rather than individual punitive sentiments, the general measure of punitiveness reflects cognitive and emotional reactions of a different nature (e.g. the quality of work of the court system), which means that the information on public attitudes it produces could be misleading.","Klíčová slova: public attitudes to punishment, new punitiveness, restorative justice, prison population, ESS R 5"

The authors focus on socio-cultural integration, the pre- and post-migration factors integration depends on, and the differences in the integration process of the two communities. Using survey data they show that the integration process of each group follows a different trajectory and depends on different factors. Ukrainians tend to be more integrated than Vietnamese. The primary factor influencing the level of integration of Ukrainian migrants is the length of residence in the Czech Republic. Household composition and the residential preferences of Ukrainians play a secondary role. On average Vietnamese immigrants have resided longer in the Czech Republic, but the increasing length of residence has a much weaker effect on the level of socio-cultural integration of members of this community. The residential preferences of Vietnamese immigrants and especially the age at which they arrived in the Czech Republic are important factors in their integration. Those Vietnamese immigrants who arrived as children are significantly more integrated than those who arrived as adults. These results suggest that the socio-cultural integration of Vietnamese immigrants depends primarily on socialisation in the Czech Republic.","Klíčová slova: integration of immigrants, labour migration, Czech Republic, socio-cultural integration, dimensions of assimilation"

To test comparability, the classic 21-item tool is used to measure ten different types of value orientation. These value types are based on Schwartz's original basic human values theory. In order to test equivalence, a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) was used. The results of the analyses show that the configural and metric equivalences of all seven value types are valid in only 10 out of 23 countries. However, even in those 10 countries, it is impossible to fully rely on scalar equivalence. For more detail, in many countries it is possible to carry out valid comparisons of relations and value types, as well as of other value attitudes or socio-demographic indicators. However, it is not possible to compare national averages of the seven value types. The article then demonstrates that the seven value types are longitudinally comparable across every round of the ESS in the Czech Republic. The second part of the article points out some of the problems in the Czech Republic with the PVQ comparison between different social groups delineated by gender, age, and education. While the averages of the seven value types can be sometimes compared in all groups (male, female), in some cases it is necessary either to amalgamate the groups or to decrease their quantity (age groups, education levels of groups).","Klíčová slova: PVQ scale, human values, European Social Survey, metric and scalar equivalences, multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis"

The overview starts with the functional definitions (descriptive and socio-cultural) typical for the positivist and modern period of rural studies. Descriptive and sociocultural definitions derive from the rural-urban dichotomy or continuum, and the rural space is defined in relation to cities as non-urban space. Since the 1980s the political-economic approach has significantly influenced rural studies, transformed them into a more critical science, and introduced a definition of the rural as a locality. This definition, however, only became accepted when it was combined with a definition of the rural as social representation. That definition is a product of the cultural turn in rural studies that has occurred since the 1990s, when post-modern and post-structural approaches penetrated rural studies and promoted fruitful scholarly discussion that then positioned rural geography firmly among other geographical sub-disciplines. Current hybrid approaches to the conceptualisation of rural space combine both material and ideational definitions of the rural and include also rural practices, through which the material and the ideational rural are interlinked.","Klíčová slova: rural space, definition, rural studies"

It aims to understand why private rental housing is perceived as a sub-optimal housing solution for young adults, whether this affects their family plans, and which policy design could change that. The article uses qualitative research techniques to analyse mental frames, opinions, and attitudes of both potential tenants and landlords towards rental housing. The authors argue that the main problem of rental housing for young tenants is the short-term lease. Lack of mutual trust between tenants and landlords is a main cause of short-term contracts in the private rental segment. The insecurity it produces among young tenants contributes to delayed family formation. A policy tool aiming to overcome that distrust between tenants and private landlords through the involvement of an independent third party as a guarantor of the relationship is discussed.","Klíčová slova: housing policy, rental housing, focus group, young households, family planning, Czech Republic"

Given the country's less advantageous economic status, Romania seems an ideal candidate on which to research the potential conflicts between such criteria of food choice. As the analysis is built on data from the Special Eurobarometer 389, some comparative findings are also presented between Romania and the rest of the EU, particularly, the EU-15 and the EU-11 (EU-12 minus Romania) country group. The results show that in Romania the manifest variables of food choice criteria are split into two latent constructs: quality related aspects on one hand and price on the other, while in the majority of other countries price enters the same axis as quality. Thus, on the macro-level it is possible to conclude that Romanians' food preferences have their roots in two sources and fit a quality vs price model. An investigation of the socio-demographic determinants of these two preference criteria confirms the role of Bourdieu's distinction regarding the influence of social class on these preferences. In Romania, like in the rest of Europe, the price preference is associated with a precarious socio-economic status, while the preference for quality seems to be a habitus specific to a higher social status. The most salient difference between Romania and the two country groups is that in Romania neither age nor gender and only socio-economic background and place of residence have an influence on the studied preferences.","Klíčová slova: food consumption, quality cues, price-constraint, social status, distinction, Eurobarometer, Romania"

The Effect of Inequality and Income on Institutional Trust in East-Central Europe","Gergő Medve-Bálint, Zsolt Boda","Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest","Compared to Western Europe, the new democracies of East-Central Europe (ECE) demonstrate substantially lower levels of institutional trust. Because trust in state institutions is an indicator of the public approval and legitimacy of a political system, low trust levels are a cause for concern. The paper addresses a particular aspect of this broad issue by focusing on how country-level wealth and inequality and individual-level economic situation and sociotropic evaluations affect institutional trust in ECE in comparison with Western Europe. A multi-level analysis performed on the 2010 European Social Survey dataset reveals that substantial differences exist between the two sides of the continent. While sociotropic measures show a uniformly strong, positive association with institutional trust, the marginal effect of relative income is positive in Western but negative in East-Central Europe. Moreover, although social inequality is inversely related to institutional trust, four ECE countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia), where relatively low inequality is accompanied by low levels of institutional trust, deviate from the general trend. The paper suggests that the causes of these differences may be attributed to the interplay between specific characteristics of ECE political economies and the strongly egalitarian attitudes of East-Central European citizens.","Klíčová slova: institutional trust, East-Central Europe, income, inequality"

In this paper, the author shows that the theory of taste developed in Distinction is one concerned primarily with the origins and only secondarily with the functions of taste. The author further argues that this theory is inseparable from Bourdieu's practice-theoretical project; it therefore cannot be coherently understood or evaluated unless it is presented in those terms (with habitus as the centrepiece concept). To that end, the author engages in a close reading of the basic argument in Distinction and shows that, according to Bourdieu, there is a tight (dynamically adjusting) relationship between tastes, conscious preferences, practical anticipations, and accumulated competences. Likes and dislikes function as partial glimpses into the store of practical capacities for cultural appropriation accumulated by a person. Most importantly, tastes operate via practical anticipatory action and not by conscious regulation. The author closes by outlining the implications of Bourdieu's 'scandalous' proposal for future research in the sociology of taste.","Klíčová slova: habitus, taste, Bourdieu, distinction, practice"

This article focuses on parents who challenge this norm by deciding to refuse to allow their child to be vaccinated. Twenty-two parents whose children were not vaccinated were interviewed and several participant observations were conducted at public lectures on immunisation and at meetings of parents who actively take part in the debates against compulsory vaccination. The article analyses groups in the Czech Republic that are critical of vaccines in the context of the crisis of trust in biomedical knowledge. It identifi es key factors affecting parents' critical views of vaccination and highlights their previous experience with health authorities and the feeling of a loss of faith in the trustworthiness of biomedicine as the key motives infl uencing their decision to refuse vaccination. The decision to vaccinate is analysed as a part of the process of the 'will to health' that occurs in the context of an ongoing negotiation between different notions of risk.","Klíčová slova: anti-vaccination movement, biopolitics, health, medicine, risk, vaccination"

Nešpor,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i., Praha","The late Miloslav Petrusek (1936-2012) was undoubtedly one of the most important figures in the history of Czech sociology. He was one of a few sociologists who revived the discipline in the 1960s and was a talented organiser and a co-founder of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University in the 1990s. He was also a gifted teacher. However, owing to his busy organisational role, extensive teaching activities, and the publishing ban and restrictions he was subject to during the communist era, it is difficult to define the 'real Petrusek' in terms of his sociological thinking. The author argues that insight into his thought can, paradoxically, be found in the work he did during the most restricted period of his life, i.e. in the late 1980s, when Petrusek and his colleague Josef Alan published Sociologický obzor (Sociological Horizon), probably the only samizdat sociological journal in the world (1987-1989). In this journal Petrusek was not bound by external restrictions or his various other activities and he proved to be a particularly original analyst and thinker. He defined an 'alternative sociology', which was based primarily on the sociological analysis of literature and the performing arts as well as on his own profound knowledge of classical and contemporary sociology, which allowed him to shed light on a range of pressing contemporary social issues such as gender relations, the social perception of time and progress, the dissemination and dissolution of higher education, social stratification, and the approaching post-communist era. Petrusek contributed 83 different and, in the main, highly valued texts to Sociologický obzor that often drew attention to the crucial social issues of late modernisation (not only in reference to communist societies) and criticised the academic impotence of the 'official' Marxist-Leninist sociology of the time.","Klíčová slova: Miloslav Petrusek, Czech sociology, Marxist sociology, history of sociology, communist regime"

Rudoltice near Lanškroun in Pardubice is a specific case of a municipality that chose to prioritise extensive municipal housing construction. The municipality used government subsidies to construct a new neighbourhood called Zámeček, which, with its nearly 1000 inhabitants, caused the local population to double between 2006 and 2009. In this article, the author explores the roots of this large-scale project of municipal housing construction by specifically combining its national, regional, and local contexts. The local municipality's decisions and its ambitions and expectations for growth and prosperity were embedded in the micro-regional context of the successful economic transformation and development it had experienced since the 1990s and were made possible by changes in national housing policies and the devolution of policy decisions to the municipalities. Using the concept of (new) socio-spatial formation this article analyses the neighbourhood of Zámeček as a case of residential segregation. It argues that, even though its population is still relatively heterogeneous compared to other segregated localities in the Czechia, the neighbourhood is being shaped by an ongoing process of segregation. The specific supply of affordable housing in Zámeček meets a demand for housing from low income households in other regions where municipalities do not provide affordable housing.","Klíčová slova: housing policy, municipal housing construction, residential segregation, new socio-spatial formations, Czechia"

The article consists of two main parts, the first of which focuses on how Beneš made the conceptual and practical transition from theory to practice, from sociology to politics, a form of politics described here as 'academic', while the second is devoted to the issue of nationality in Beneš's sociology and politics from the perspective of the sociology of social identities. Beneš's sociology had an instrumental role in the formation of Czechoslovak national identity, most notably with respect to the construction of social boundaries of 'us' and 'them' in relation to Germans (especially between Czechs on one hand and Germans on the other), and it offered objects of national identification typical for the national movements of small nations and specifically of Czech society.

Compared to other interviewing techniques, its main advantage is its combination of a thematic focus and sensitivity to the perspective of the interviewee. The authors demonstrate that TOBI is made up of several constituents: first, it is a speech infrastructure (comprising a conversational and a narrative component), and second, it encompasses three kinds of relevance (biographical relevance, identity relevance and specific thematic relevance). The main part of the article is devoted to an analysis of the types and forms of relevance that occur in the corpus of oral history biographical interviews. The analysis shows that, contrary to the common effort of researchers to increase the significance of a respondent's testimony by emphasising the specific thematic relevance, the biographical and identity relevances are equally important for successfully capturing the actor's perspective and smoothly conducting a TOBI. In their explication of relevance and its forms the authors draw on the theory of relevance developed by Alfred Schütz.","Klíčová slova: qualitative methodology, biographical interview, narrative, relevance, hypothetical relevance, Alfred Schütz, oral history"

The relational concept of the poorest class here refers to individuals united by specific social practices and strategies that are determined by their position and mutual proximity within a social space. The article's theoretical framework is anthropologist Nancy Munn's practice-based or agent-oriented approach to time and space, according to which socio-cultural practices do not just occur in time and space but also create or produce that time and space. The concept of temporalisation (time and space) is used in this respect to refer to a variegated, symbolic process whose forms can encompass different degrees of awareness and consideration of the dimension of time. Through the optics of this theoretical approach the article examines four dimensions of agent-based temporalisation: (1) the tactical nature of time, (2) the relation between past, present, and future, (3) time reckoning, and (4) the rhythm of everyday practices. The text presents data from ethnographic field research conducted in the urban setting of the City of Pilsen. The aforementioned dimensions of time are understood as a reflection of social structures, that is, of the position of agents in a social space associated with poverty and marginalisation.","Klíčová slova: homeless, poorest class, temporalisation, past - present - future, time-reckoning, rhythm of everyday practices, tactical nature of time, ethnography"

However, most research on the prison system and its impact on individuals has focused on various aspects of inmates' lives. This article focuses on other important subjects in the prison system, ones whose perspective has been largely ignored - prison guards. The first part of this article introduces prison as a medium through which to analyse modern mechanisms of power and the changing conceptualisation of risks. The second part of the article examines the subjective views of prison guards. The authors conducted 17 in-depth interviews with prison guards working in Czech C-type prisons in order to understand how the prison guards themselves conceptualise their role in the prison system and how they construct the meaning of prison and punishment. The aim of the article is to analyse how the position of various participants in the prison system is negotiated and how the ideas of 'control' and 'power' are established. The authors find that prison guards experience a sense of blurred boundaries between those who are guarded and those who guard. They see themselves as having no control over the prison environment and highlight the control the prisoners have over them through institutional regulations.","Klíčová slova: power, prison, prison guards, punishment, total institution"

However, sociological inquiry and discussion found a home, at least temporarily, in various less regulated departmental, regional and technical institutes, which came to represent the 'grey zone' of contemporary Czech sociology, i.e. the space between official, state-sanctioned sociological work and prohibited, dissident sociology (and where a significant number of persecuted sociologists were able to retain their jobs). One such institute, the House of Technology inPardubice, played a particularly significant role in the 1970s and, to a lesser extent, in the 1980s. For a decade after 1969 it hosted the dissolved academic Department of the Sociology of Industry (V. Herstus, O. Sedláček, D. Slejška) and its research activities, the former Institute for Social Analysis (from Hradec Králové), and a further 20-30 external (part-time) workers. The House of Technology conducted around 150 empirical surveys, especially in the fields of the sociology of work and the sociology of organisation and published a number of books in the field of sociology and its own journal, Analýza (Analysis), which in the first few years presented theoretical discussions and later the results of empirical research. In this article the author provides a broad analysis of the organisational background and results of the various activities of the House of Technology, which, whilst significant in terms of Czech sociology at the time, were, the author concludes, unable to serve as an effective substitute for real academic work. Indeed, it was more a research than an academic institution and the main contribution it made to Czech sociology was the professional 'life jacket' it offered persecuted scholars.","Klíčová slova: House of Technology in Pardubice, Czech sociology, history of sociology, communism, sociology of work, sociology of organisation"

It sets out from the thesis that the classic concepts of citizenship, which are linked to the nation state, are slowly but steadily losing their monopoly on explaining the relationship between individuals, the political community and government. Based on a theoretical discussion of the new models of citizenship, the authors seek to identify the elements of 'post-national' citizenship. The main research goal of the analysis is to discover the conditions in which elements of post-national citizenship are most likely to occur. The analysis is based on aggregated individual (survey) data (from the ESS 2008 and the EVS 2008) and macro contextual data on European Union countries. On the macro (country) level, the authors conduct a hierarchical cluster analysis and crisp set QCA and make the following findings. First, two groups of countries are formed: (a) a fairly homogeneous group of six 'post-national' citizenship countries; and (b) a more heterogeneous group of classic citizenship countries. Second, 'post-national' citizenship is to be expected in countries in which the following conditions are combined: on the one hand, secularised and post-industrial societies with less emphasis on a knowledge society, and on the other hand, societies with a stable national status where knowledge is important.","Klíčová slova: post-national citizenship, typology of countries, globalisation, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), European Union"

This article seeks to determine the gender-specific effectiveness of this drug prevention programme. The authors conducted a randomised trial of the programme on a total of 1874 children (with a mean age of 11.8 years). They collected data using a questionnaire from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs. Baseline testing was conducted among sixth-grade students immediately prior to the programme's implementation, and five follow-up tests were carried out 9, 12, 21, 24, and 33 months after the baseline testing. Gender-specific effectiveness was tested using three indicators: the 30-day prevalence of any tobacco or cannabis use and the 30-day prevalence of any drunkenness. The results comparing the experimental and control groups provide evidence of statistically significant effects for any drunkenness among boys and any tobacco use among girls in the 30 days prior to testing. The programme was found to have positive effects on both genders' cannabis use, with girls showing lower levels of cannabis use even 33 months after the baseline test. Given the gender equality approach to drug prevention, differences in outcome may be overcome by adding gender-specifi c elements to the intervention programme's curriculum.","Klíčová slova: adolescence, equality in results, gender, psychoactive substances, school-based prevention"

The author assumes that the absence of new technology should be addressed in relation to existing patterns of cultural consumption and media preferences, and she attempts to understand the problem of digital exclusion within the context of other types of structural inequalities. Since digital technology is understood not just as a technical tool but as a social phenomenon directly related to everyday practices, the individual's class position and cultural capital, digital exclusion is not viewed simply as a narrow problem of access. Instead of looking at the binary gap between technology haves and have-nots, the author takes the multilevel structure of digital access into account. The findings of a quantitative survey involving a representative sample of 820 residents in the two biggest Slovenian cities-Ljubljana and Maribor-show that, first, three types of digital exclusion exist: digitally unmotivated with high cultural capital; overall excluded with weak cultural capital; and digitally self-excluded with moderate cultural capital. Second, the study suggests that all three digital exclusion groups are, more than by class, divided by cultural engagement and media taste, which provides important possibilities for future research.","Klíčová slova: digital divide, cultural capital, Internet non-users, media consumption, digital inequality, Slovenia"

Coser (1913-2003), the American sociologist who became renowned as one of the founders of 'conflict sociology'. Born in Berlin, Coser had to leave his homeland for political reasons and he spent the years before Nazi Germany's invasion of France in Paris. Coser then fled to the United States and started his academic career there at the College of the University of Chicago. An abridged version of the PhD thesis he wrote at Columbia University was published as The Functions of Social Conflict, which earned him recognition, a promotion, and made him a figure of authority for sociologists in the 1960s. In this article the author draws on archival materials to examine Coser's life, major publications and achievements. His intellectual trajectory from Marxism to Mertonian Functionalism, his strong commitment to a Weberian view of the separation of politics from scholarship, the breadth of his erudition in literature and classical sociological theory, and his lifelong place in New York intellectual circles and intellectual magazines made him an extraordinary figure even amongst his contemporaries.","Klíčová slova: Lewis A.

Coser's 'greedy institutions' demand undivided time and loyalty from the individual who will voluntarily devote him/herself for exclusive benefits only granted to loyal followers. Although the ancient authorities have vanished-princes with their court Jews, masters with their servants, or religious and political missionaries- one can argue that the idea of the greedy institution is far from obsolete today. Management consultants, 24/7 old-age carers from Eastern Europe and particularly the 'hive mind' of new social media show that a revisiting of Coser's theory can help in understanding modern forms of greed in institutions. This awareness may enhance vigilance against intrusions into personal autonomy.","Klíčová slova: greedy institutions, Lewis Coser, new media, 24/7 migrant carers, spin doctors, consultants, power relations"

This intention was tied to the needs of a society of mass production and was based on the standardisation and normalisation not only of production and industry facilities, but also of settlements and dwellings and even of the individual activities of people and their lives as a whole. In this society, the concentration of workers in larger factories and their subordination to precise division of labour entailed the imposition of disciplinary power over their bodies and the indoctrination of their minds with corporate ideology. All this, along with the surveillance and control of the people's lives, not just at work in the production plant but also in their homes, their schools, during their leisure time activities, and even through the overall urban layout itself, combined to give the town's inhabitants a specific collective identity.

This is one reason why the authors decided to use the Republic of Venice to study the relationship between the social and physical space and chart the ways in which social inequalities at the dawn of the modern era were reflected in the organisation of the urban space. They present Venice as 'two cities in one': Venice the city built and portrayed from the perspective of the privileged classes, i.e. the viewpoint of those who had themselves transported through the city on gondolas; and Venice the city of the pedestrian traffic of the lower classes, excluded from political life. The authors set out to attain a better understanding of the deep social and political inequalities that existed in Venice on the one hand and of how it endured a thousand years of internal political stability without experiencing a single attempt at revolt, revolution or social uprising on the other. They therefore focus not just on forms of stratification, segregation and exclusion, but also on how Venetian society integrated its marginalised members and how it accorded them social and cultural relevance and recognition.","Klíčová slova: socio-spatial structures, social inequalities, Venice, Renaissance, carnival"

In this article the author examines the process of the formation of hidden cultural meanings and their influence on the action of carrier groups and the practices of remembering. He interprets the relationship between collective memory and urban space not as a constant one but as a dynamic process. A space is defined by the carrier group that uses it and the group is formed by a collective memory that is influenced by strong meanings. The case of the attack on Liberty Square and on the Memorial of Soviet heroes in Budapest is analysed by defining hidden meanings narrated by different carrier groups. The square is a space filled with strong and iconic meanings that are hidden beneath different layers of the past. The power of extraordinary events brings these meanings to the surface and creates conflict between different carrier groups.","Klíčová slova: collective memory, urban space, cultural sociology, meanings, iconicity"

It presents a detailed discussion of the privatisation thesis in relation to the perceived 'loss of public space' and in relation to social exclusion, which many authors see as one of the key distinguishing features of privatised spaces. Many scholars regard shopping centres as the exemplification of privatised space. Therefore, this paper presents an empirical study of Czech shopping centres and focuses on the process of exclusion therein. Two kinds of exclusion are identified in the research. One is formal exclusion and it derives from the shopping centres' house rules, an analysis of which reveals their key features to be issues of control, an inherent ambiguity, and hidden personalisation. The second kind of exclusion identifi ed, an informal type, derives mostly from the preventive identification of 'unwelcome' groups, who are usually defined in terms of their physical appearance. Members of these groups, most notably homeless people, tend to be excluded from the shopping centres on the basis of a conflation of the meanings of security and comfort. However, the process of exclusion is in turn altered and negotiated by the personal power relations between the security guards and the excluded.","Klíčová slova: urban sociology, privatised space, exclusion, shopping centre, city"

Drawing on cultural theory, the article presents space as a multifaceted entity that is perceived, constructed, and reproduced through everyday praxis. It stresses on the situatedness and contextuality of the perception, construction, and representation of spatial categories and relations. To this end, three dimensions of space are discussed: (i) the representation of space in map form, one possible version of which is the concept of the route, founded on a topological representation of space; (ii) the scalar dimension of space, which involves the scaled representation of everyday space and the various socially, economically, and culturally determined scalar levels on which everyday experience occurs; (iii) the dimension of spatial continuity, which the authors discuss in conjunction with reflections on the ways in which space is represented, and next to the notion of space as an omnidirectional continuous medium they introduce a concept in which space is understood as a series of separate, meaningful entities integrated through mobile technologies to form a time-space network. This theoretical discussion is accompanied by an empirical section that draws on the spatial experiences of five users of power wheelchairs to describe examples of technologically and culturally conditioned imaginations of space.","Klíčová slova: space, everydayness, space representation, map, route, scale, space continuity/discontinuity, wheelchair users"

The authors analyse the consequences of educational expansion on unequal chances by social origin of attaining a secondary education with a school-leaving certificate ('maturita'). This certificate is a prerequisite for the transition to tertiary education in the Czech educational system. The article is based on the theories of maximally maintained inequality (MMI) and effectively maintained inequality (EMI). The authors analyse data from PISA 2000 and 2009 (Programme for International Student Assessment) in the Czech Republic. They support the theory of EMI over MMI. Vertical differentiation by social origin decreased between 2000 and 2009. Contrary to the assumptions of MMI, the chances of attaining a school-leaving certificate are increasing for children from the lower social classes, but only in one type of secondary education (in secondary technical schools). This is occurring because there has been an increasing horizontal diversification of schools offering a school-leaving certificate (on the basis of the assumptions of EMI). Socioeconomic variables have a stronger effect on attendance at grammar schools with a school-leaving certificate. The social and economic exclusivity of this branch of secondary education increased between 2000 and 2009.","Klíčová slova: education, inequality, social stratifi cation, unequal chances, Czech secondary school system"

It takes as examples for analysis the erection of statues of the title hero of Jaroslav Hašek's novel The Good Soldier Svejk in the border region of western Ukraine. It looks at the political and social contexts of creative readings of this novel and how such readings interfered with the dominant state-backed representations of the past and upset historical interpretations that had become deeply anchored in the national discourse. The erection of these statues also had the effect of expanding room for the imagination and fostering discussion of local cross-border cooperation. Activities of this nature tend to dowplay rather than emphasise the state border that cuts through the Urkainian-Polish border region. Methodologically the article is based on an ethnographic study of the unveiling of Svejk statues in Skelivce, Uzhhorod (Ukraine) and Przemyśl (Poland). These new contextualisations of Svejk help to establish an alternative representation of the past and political geography of the borderland area and make Svejk into an object that emphasises the differences between the inhabitants of the Ukrianian-Polish borderland on the one hand and the inland populations of these two stages on the other.","Klíčová slova: collective memory, mimesis, bricolage, borders, boundary object, Svejk"

It focuses on the determinants of voting unity of parliamentary party groups measured using the Rice index and on the determinants of the composition of legislative coalitions measured as the relative frequency of majorities formed by two parliamentary party groups voting together. The authors find that patterns of government coalitions are present in both the Senate as and the Chamber of Deputies: senatorial groups of government parties vote more uniformly and more often together than do opposition party groups. The Senate is also less ideological and more consensual than the Chamber of Deputies: a similar ideological profile of two parties in the Senate is a weaker determinant of their senatorial groups voting together. Voting majorities are in general much broader in the Senate than in the Chamber of Deputies.,"Klíčová slova: parliamentary party groups, party discipline, party unity, party cohesion, Rice index, roll-call voting, legislative behaviour, Senate, Czech Republic"

The comparison is performed on three levels: institutional affiliation (affiliation with a university, a learned society, and the publishing platform of a journal); objective conceptual agreement or variance (the degree to which general sociological theories, methodological opinions, evaluative judgements in science are shared); and subjective affiliation with a certain school (the existence of declared support for one school over the other, the antagonism of 'us' versus 'them' in reviews and debates, ties between a teacher and a student). The opposition between the two schools is most apparent on the institutional level and to some degree on the level of subjective affiliation. On the level of conceptual agreement within one school and opposition to the other, a number of alleged dichotomies and differences are found to be more a myth than a reality. The biggest difference found on that level is a greater inclination towards quantitative methods in the Prague school and towards qualitative methods in the Brno school. As it is impossible to generalise these and other characteristics, the author argues that the concept of academic schools in Czech interwar sociology is best understood using the paradigm of ideal types, rather than as a reflection of a real dividing line, and additionally, for a description of reality, by applying the concept of centre and periphery employed in subculture studies.","Klíčová slova: Czech sociology, history, 20th century, Brno sociology, Prague sociology, scientific schools"

While it criticises Pavlinek's initial interpretation, it argues for a reconstruction that is sensitive to Open Marxism's crucial notion of mediation of the central capitalist abstraction, which is a self-valorising value. Mediation analysis reveals the contradictory existence of capitalist social forms and consequently has the capacity to identify the source of their internal negativity. It grasps the existence of manifold elements of the capitalist totality on a conceptually objective basis. Individual human subjects exist in and at the same moment against capitalist society; it is through them, as contradictory identities, that the class struggle is fought. Accusing Open Marxism of class reductionism is false, because such an objection fails to distinguish between formal (analytical) and determinate (dialectical) abstraction as two different tools for analysing social reality. To confuse one with the other generates conceptual chaos at the very outset of the process of understanding Marxist dialectics.","Klíčová slova: Open Marxism, capitalism, dialectics, Marx, Adorno, critical theory, class struggle"

In addressing this question, this study argues that systematic differences in institutional trust are related to salience. Institutions with high visibility or salience to the public, i.e. government, lower chambre and president, will be trusted on the basis of their perceived political and economic performance. In contrast, institutions that are less salient to citizens are not evaluated on the basis of performance but on more diffuse criteria. Competing models of trust are divided into two groups. Top down explanations emphasise what institutions do; and hence focus on political and economic performance. Bottom up accounts of institutional trust refer to social mechanisms such as values, culture and knowledge. The empirical results presented in this study reveal that trust in salient political institutions is more strongly shaped by political performance. Otherwise, there is no systematic pattern to the determinants of trust in political institutions. These results suggest that citizen trust in political institutions emerges from a variety of top down and bottom up mechanisms, where salient institutions are different in that they are evaluated more on the basis of the political performance of office-holders.","Klíčová slova: institutional trust, differential trust, levels of governance, salience, political sociology, Czech Republic"

Erickson1, Mark van der Maas1, Andrew D. Hathaway2","1
University of Toronto;2
University of Guelph","Deterrence research has evolved considerably since the 1970s when a favourite offence for study was the emerging phenomenon of widespread cannabis use among mainstream populations. The deterrent model of crime prevention has expanded far beyond the study of objective and subjective indicators of certainty and severity to encompass social support, moral evaluations, peer involvement and, most recently, risk sensitivity and situational factors. Most earlier research found no evidence of deterrence of cannabis use, a fi nding attributed to its low actual and perceived risk of arrest and changes in public attitudes. This interview study with adult experienced cannabis users drawn from a representative survey base in Toronto, Canada, where possession is still treated as a criminal offence, provides a more nuanced interpretation of deterrence. The authors found that users had generally inaccurate knowledge about the current law and penalties and believed they would avoid arrest in the future. However, they were not oblivious to the possibility of police intervention, and took precautions such as carrying small amounts and avoiding public use. Thus, users were not unaffected by the law, but rather these discreet practices illustrate the operation of restrictive deterrence, shaping their choices of when, where and how to commit the crime of cannabis use. Further research on deterrence should examine situated choices by risk-sensitive offenders, and should also include cross-national patterns of arrest and user risk perceptions. While cannabis continues to be prohibited by international treaties, the reality of widespread use presents opportunities for innovative deterrence studies into this normalised yet illegal crime. The variation in policies, penalty structures and enforcement across European nations, compared to those in other Western jurisdictions, can foster relevant research for a transatlantic discussion about global drug policy transformation.","Klíčová slova: deterrence, cannabis, drug policy, drug arrests, public opinion, cross-national comparisons, Canada"

Two dominant approaches to measuring the ideological orientations of the public are self-identification and expert evaluation of attitudes and value orientations. Both approaches are also a common ingredient in international comparative research. In this article the authors first focus on the strengths and methodological weaknesses of those approaches. They then introduce their method of latent ideological types as a different approach. They present the principles of the method, the necessary sequence of steps, and conclude with its concrete application using CSES Slovakia 2010 data. The method of latent ideological types is based on subjective placements on a given set of ideological orientations or scales. The non-manifest ideological inclinations of the respondents are then determined from their attitudes and opinions. Using attitude variables, definitional patterns and cluster analysis the authors proceed from manifest ideological types to latent ideological types. The resulting latent ideological positions of the respondents may differ from their manifest self-identifications. The advantages of knowing the latent positions are discussed.","Klíčová slova: manifest ideological types, latent ideological types, left-right scale, cluster analysis"

This approach here makes it possible to analyse and distinguish several other concepts of the sociology of religion that can be used to take a more differentiated look to the often all-encompassing application of the concept of secularisation, which both embraces and diminishes Weber's multidimensional concept of 'disenchantment' (Entzauberung). Drawing on Niklas Luhmann's concepts of 'segmentary differentiation' and the 'surplus effect', the author attempts to formulate a radically different sociological concept of religion based not on a substantive definition of its sacred content but on the historical sociology of action, whereby religion can be interpreted through its specific focus on 'meaning' as a particular type of social relationship and its corresponding 'chance' (Weber) of understanding. Other cultural (and political) phenomena of modern society (confessionalism, political theology) whose applicability and effect are not explained away or exhausted/voided by the secularisation theory can also be analysed as 'religious'. To provide these phenomena with a context the author uses the term 'religious culture' to aggregate of everything people of a particular period know and think about their religion, how they evaluate it, and to what degree they identify with it. The pluralisation of religion can then be demonstrated not just on a surface level (for instance, in term of the rise of new sects, client cults, and cult movements, participation in various spiritual and esoteric activities), but more generally as the potential or real presence of specifically religious phenomena in the public space and as a particular type of social relationship: both between actors reciprocally, and between actors on the one hand and institutions on the other, and finally also between institutions.","Klíčová slova: sociology of religion, secularisation, Entzauberung, Max Weber"

Drawing on Edward Soja's model of the trialectics of spatiality and Petr Vašát's empirically based concept of heterotopia, the author describes three spheres (or space-types) of the object: (1) a historical and physical description of the object; (2) the dominant actors' representations of the object (including politicians, municipal police, public authorities, and the local media); and (3) the object as a heterotopic 'Hilton' (the emic name of the object). He focuses mainly on the differences or junctions of these spheres/spaces. The empirical basis of this study is formed by data from ethnographic participant observation of the homeless, interviews, and various texts (e.g. media messages, public notices), which are processed in MAXQDA. There are some areas of contradiction between the three spaces: the negative descriptions by the dominant actors versus the social practices (e.g. pooling, borrowing) and strong social relationships in the Hilton, the seemingly irrational patterns of exploitation of the Hilton, the contrast between the filth outside the building and the clean state of the rooms, i.e. between chaos and order, the disparate views taken of dogs that live in the Hilton too, and ecological and hygienic problems, and so on. The negative view taken by local residents generates a fear of the homeless, which partly legitimises the ritual police inspects of the Hilton, and puts the public in the paradoxical position of both wanting to solve the problem, but rejecting the available tools to do so.","Klíčová slova: homelessness, trialectics of spatiality, heterotopia, dominant actors, social production of space"

The voices of social conservatives were raised and were answered by the Minister of Education, who launched a reform of educational curricula to exclude sex education. This article analyses the discursive strategies employed by conservative opponents of sex education and highlights the interpretive repertoires of sexuality and gender. The authors argue that Czech conservatives deploy both a moral panic strategy and a discursive strategy of empowerment that uses positive sanctions to support 'good sex', defined exclusively as marital, procreative heterosex. This interpretive repertoire of 'good and healthy sexuality' is universally intelligible and thus has the potential to resonate not only with social conservatives but throughout society. When combined with other socially conservative agendas it has the capacity to regiment the public space and diminish the role of public institutions.","Klíčová slova: sex education, discursive strategies, gender, conservatism, Czech Republic"

'Development' represents a good field for such analysis. Power tends to be a neglected issue and does not figure in governmental, non-governmental, or international discourse. In the academic field it is less overlooked, but in the Czech-Slovak environment there is as yet no theoretical overview of the various approaches to studying power and 'development'. This article sets out to answer the question of how best to examine power in 'development' and replies with a multidisciplinary approach. It begins by focusing on the understanding of power within the context of its first dimension, which is most vividly reflected in the perception of the World Bank as a dominant actor. The second part of the article concentrates on power in development discourse. The third part analyses disciplinary power in relations of 'development' cooperation. The fourth looks at agency, which disobeys the discourse and structure, in order to recognise the capacity for resistance among even the least advantaged. The final part focuses on governmentality and 'development'. In the conclusion the author attempts to make a brief synthesis of these approaches, on the one hand viewing power as a kind of strategic situation, but on the other hand arguing the importance not to overlook the enormous power of structure just as much as the capacity of certain privileged actors to influence it. What is important then is a subjectivity of power.","Klíčová slova: development, power, discourse, agency, structure, governmentality"

In the analysis the author focuses on analytical issues, including the problem of identifying buzerantos and the semiotic aspects of identification methods that can be observed in the context of conjunctural events of social practice. Other issues the author deals with include how this identification process relates to genre, style and discourse, how subjectivity is involved in discourse, and in what ways members' resources are changing the limits of discourse.

Homelessness is a fact that has various causes, and the article tries to link the factors behind and barriers to the successful reintegration of the homeless with potential state interventions in the area of housing and housing policy to reinforce the success of reintegration. Although effective housing policy assistance is not the sole precondition for the successful reintegration of homeless people into long-term housing, without such assistance reintegration is not possible. Despite the relative broadness of existing studies of homelessness in the Czech Republic, to date there is none that focuses on this dimension, and analyses the factors behind and barriers to the successful reintegration of the homeless in greater detail and in reference to the effectiveness of assistance from the housing policy sphere. The authors thus also assess existing public assistance to the homeless in the sphere of housing and innovative changes that could be made to this assistance in the form of 'guaranteed housing'. In order to analyse the factors behind and barriers to the successful reintegration of the homeless into long-term housing the authors draw on fi ndings from their own qualitative survey of social workers and homeless people conducted in the Czech Republic's three largest cities. Given that housing systems in post-socialist countries followed a similar path of development, the conclusions from this research could be of more general validity and could serve as resource for other post-socialist countries.","Klíčová slova: homelessness, housing policy, guaranteed housing, Czech Republic"

For her reflections on 'green fatigue' the author borrowed economist Alberta O. Hirschman's psychological concept of the potential for disappointment. Whether and to what extent an individual is able to withstand failure depends on one's mental fitness, the degree of support received from one's social group, and historical and other circumstances. This article considers the proposition that the potential for disappointment largely hinges on what a person's motivation is to engage in environmentally-oriented behaviour. The author works with a typology of motivations derived from categories of normative ethics: teleological and deontological ethics and virtue ethics. The article first describes these motivational types on a general level and then examines them in relation to environmentalism. The findings of this study may have practical as well as theoretical significance: environmental problems cannot be tackled solely through technical and scientific efforts founded on goal-directed, teleological motivations, as these are at risk of succumbing to disappointment and fatigue. Environmental problems must be approached from a broad humanistic perspective, as it is on that level that the ethics of environmental virtue take shape and deontological motivations are reinforced - two approaches that are not grounded in great expectations and are thus relatively resistant to disappointment from negative environmental development and provide a basis for effective goal-directed behaviour.","Klíčová slova: : environmentally oriented motivations of individuals, teleology, deontology, virtue ethics, potential for disappointment"

Based on de Certeau's distinction between place and space, public space is analysed as a phenomenon transcending the material reality of a city. It is argued that public space is established in the process of interaction between the social reality of the city on the one hand and its regulative processes on the other. The former refers in particular to the phenomenological duality of urban public places, which are perceived as attractive and threatening at the same time. The latter includes internal and external processes of behavioural regulation. Following the classic works of Goffman and Lofland and current research on urban civility and interaction, it is argued that internal regulation establishes an 'urban order' that governs the rules of interaction and behaviour in the urban public space. In conclusion, an interpretative approach to the urban public space is suggested. In this view, the public space, while physically framed by the city's material reality, is itself a process of constant production and reproduction of shared meanings attached to places. As a shared stock of knowledge, it is also subject to learning and ongoing negotiation.","Klíčová slova: : city, public space, urban order, social control, rules of conduct"

The article is based on a study of primary and secondary sources: Bourdieu's scholarly writings, media interviews, his speeches at ceremonies, and his correspondence, and it draws on published interviews with Bourdieu's friends and colleagues.

In line with earlier studies in the field, it emerged that, although being significant predictors of trust, neither perceived disintegration nor self-enhancement mentalities predict generalised trust well. Less than 5% of the variance was explained.

This article analyses how these discourses on education affect young people in the context of the dismantling of public services and growing social uncertainty. Surveys on youth in Slovenia in the late 1990s and 2000s indicate that children are exposed to the pressure of academic success very early in their lives. The article examines the symbolic meaning of academic achievement, the importance of school success in the educational path in post-socialist Slovenia, and its influence on teenagers' self-understanding and identity construction. The analysis is based on short narratives written by secondary school students about their experiences with school (under-)achievement. The wider social context is clarified based on some research and statistical data. The analysis leads to the conclusion that striving for school success is a response to the neoliberal process of individualising responsibility, which is also reflected in 'truths' about the importance of early child care for later academic achievement-these 'truths' can be understood as normalising discourses, which have an important influence on the construction of the self and the parent-child relationship.","Klíčová slova: school achievement, Foucault, neoliberalism, discourse analysis, sociology of education, Slovenia"

It endeavours to present possible approaches to the study of human behaviour in the geographical and social environment and the limits and constraints that affect behaviour. The article is inspired by the works of Swedish geographers, who were the first to introduce the time-dimension into geographical research, thus creating a four-dimensional framework for the research of behavioural geographical phenomena. The /authors' line of argument starts with the fundamental theoretical concepts and methodological tools of time-geography. Following the presentation of the theoretical basis, the authors document and develop a critical discussion of its defi ciencies and how the discipline has tackled them. The struggle to rehabilitate time-geographyby its proponents emerged with the renaissance of the discipline and the development of new applications within different areas of social scientific research and spatial planning. The authors put forward some examples of research on new socially stimulating issues and refl ect on the cyberspace expansion that has introduced new forms of interactions and time-space constraints. Finally, the authors discuss the current potential of the spatio-temporal approachin human behaviour research within the social sciences.","Klíčová slova: human behaviour, space, time, time-geography, social science"

The article sets out to explain the concept of shrinking cities, the causes, consequences, and context of shrinkage, and to put forth a theoretical framework with which to analyse shrinkage and to outline a proposed operationalisation of this concept. In its empirical section the article describes the characteristics of Ostrava, in particular population changes, and briefl y sums up the factors at the root of shrinkage in an effort to answer whether Ostrava is indeed shrinking. The theoretical part of the article is based on a review of the relevant literature. A combination of quantitative and qualitative research was carried out for the empirical part of the study, and as part of the quantitative research an analysis was made of relevant statistical data on the development of Ostrava. The causes and consequencesof shrinkage were identifi ed and the results verifi ed using qualitativemethods such as interviews and working seminars. Ostrava reached its peak population in 1990, when it had 331,729 inhabitants (as of 31 December 1989). Since 1990 there has been a slow but steady decrease of the population, which reached 303,798 in 2009 (as of 31 December, not including 10,669 foreigners). This trend of population decrease and the changes in the town's socio-demographic structure have as yet had no fundamentally negative impact on the town's development, but it can be justifi ably assumed that further losses and changes in the structure of the population will have ever more signifi cant negative impacts on the development of the town of Ostrava.",

Not only is the 'standard' form of everyday shopping for basic provisions at corner shops now typical, but so is daily visits to specialised retail chain stores or shopping centres. Such daily shopping trips are often combined with commuting to work and school or travelling for other services and have become an important factor in the daily lives of residents. This phenomenon has led to the formation of stronger links between inhabitants within a daily urban system. The primary intensity is observed not in the core-periphery link but rather between the periphery of the agglomeration and suburban zones where most of the big shopping malls and hypermarkets are located. Frequently this is not a daily but rather an irregular or weekend activity. These places are thus becoming special centres (secondary cores) of retail business, services, and leisure time activities competing with the city centre itself. This article presents an analysis of the infl uence of spatial, socio-demographic and psychographic factors on the intensity and variability of the commute for foodstuffs and other shopping in shopping centres. The retail gravity model, shopping habits and shopping behaviour are analysed on the basis of fi eld surveys of the inhabitants from communities located in the hinterlands of Brno.",

Developing and testing a new research instrument thus represent the key aims of the pilot study. The proposed technique is 'tried out' on a group of young people living or working in Prague. Their daily activities and spatial mobility are explored and discussed against the everyday and geographical context of the young people´s lives. Theoretically the study draws on the strong tradition of time geography as well as on the new geography of everyday life. Methodologically the research combines two different types of data sources and the relevant analytical tools. First, mobile phone location data are used to record the daily trajectories of the participants.Second, deep interpretative interviews are carried out to understandthe reasons and motives behind the recorded daily trajectories. Despite a few technical obstacles in mobile phone location data processing, the pilot study proved the very promising potential of this source, especially in combination with interviews, when studying the patterns of the everyday life and individual spatial mobility of an urban population.",

The authors set out from the assumption that activities are a factor that animate the physical environment and, together with the actual quality of the physical environment, importantly contribute to the quality of life of seniors. The authors illustrate this on the basis of a sample survey conducted among seniors over the age of sixty living in fourteen large towns around the Czech Republic. The analysis shows that through the activities they engage in seniors are active participants in the rural environment. However, the intensity and variability of individual types of activities as determined by a factor analysis are mainly infl uenced by increasing health limitations, which have the biggest impact on reducing the activity of seniors. The survey also confi rmed that the physical environmentinfl uences the activity of seniors, but much less so than the authors expected. Employment and leisure-time activities in particular are infl uenced by numerous other factors that are related more to the lifestyle of the individual and by extension to the individual's cultural and social capital. The authors close the discussion with recommendations for further research on the activities of seniors in towns as an important contribution to urban economies.",

Despite pessimistic predictions about their future in the early 1990s, they are still a widespread and valued type of housing. This article, unlike other primarily economically oriented studies, analyses the situation and possible future development of Czech housing states by combining three theoretical perspectives from urban sociology: social ecology, the political economy of place, and a culturalist perspective. A contributing factor to the stable situation of housing estates is the ambivalent relationship that exists towards this type of construction, which ultimately never became convincingly stigmatised. Many of the inhabitants of such estates have moreover established fi rm roots in there and their interest in their place of residence is often sustained by a proprietarial relationship towards the fl at they live in. However, some important factors that could cause this to change in the future include the concentration of ethnic minorities in some locations and the risk of the collapse of collective negotiation among occupant-owners. A deep, empirically grounded prognosis of the future of Czech housing estates requires systematic research focused on a specific location and designed to capture the overlooked political-economic and cultural dimensions of this issue.",

The aim of the study was to analyse the incidence of bullying among university employees and to examine the organisational contexts that promote bullying. Data from three Czech public universities (N = 1533; F = 58.0%) were collected using a questionnaire distributed among academics, PhD candidates, and administrative staff. Based on a well-established definition of workplace bullying, 7.9% of the respondents reported that they had been targets of bullying during the past year, and 28.8% reported witnessing bullying during the same timeframe. The results indicated a link between hierarchical position and bullying; the majority of respondents who claimed to have been bullied identified their superiors as the perpetrators. In addition, the occurrence of bullying was significantly related to specific organisational factors, namely to a low level of cooperation among employees, a poor work climate, recent organisational changes, and a toxic organisational culture.","Klíčová slova: : workplace bullying, mobbing, universities, organisational context, toxic workplace"

Nešpor,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i., Praha","Czechoslovak sociology was among the first European national sociological traditions to become established institutionally. Lectures in sociology commenced at Charles University in the 1880s, the first professorships and departments of sociology were established in 1919, and sociology was fully established as a doctoral discipline twelve years later. All the other universities in Czechoslovakia (with the notable exception of the German University in Prague) followed suit (usually after five or so 'test' years), as did polytechnics and independent colleges specialising in social studies, where, admittedly, attempts to establish departments of sociology were only partly successful. Using archive sources, this article analyses in detail the various processes involved in the establishment of sociology at individual universities and colleges, describes the forms and content of sociological education offered and conducts a prosopographical analysis of students in this field. On average, five students graduated in sociology in Czechoslovakia each year during the interwar period, and the number of dissertations written in sociology experienced a real boom shortly after the Second World War. The number of annual graduates rose to 23 between 1945 and 1948 and to 42 between 1948 and 1953, and this despite the fact that after the coup in 1948 the communist regime declared sociology a 'bourgeois pseudoscience'. Consequently, only a very small number (5 percent) of the post-coup graduates were able to apply their sociological knowledge in their careers, and most of those who were able to did so rather late in their careers; the great majority of earlier graduates were not allowed to apply their knowledge at all. However, in Czechoslovakia it was nothing new for graduates of sociology to be unable to apply their education in their field, since the interwar and immediate post-war academic elites were made up largely of graduates of other fields, who were often unwilling to make room in academia for their younger colleagues.","Klíčová slova: Czech sociology, study of sociology, sociology students, history of sociology"

They find no interactions between family size and other variables in the analysis. The main finding is consistent across various methods of dealing with missing data.

First, it briefly summarises what reforms have been introduced and describes their internal contradictions. The author argues that these internal tensions stem not just from the introduction of 'new public management' ideas into a completely different context, but also from the fact that the conceptual bases of one of the key objectives of these reforms - greater accountability - are internally contradictory. To understand these inconsistencies, the author analyses the various meanings of 'accountability' and shows how the term differs from 'responsibility'. He then examines the understanding of accountability as a type of social relation. The author also distinguishes the different forms that accountability can assume and defines the incompatible objectives and expectations that tie them together. In the second part of the article the author analyses reforms in the EU-10 and formulates three theoretical propositions on the nature of accountability and its potential consequences: (1) too much accountability operating in too many directions can lead to professional disorientation; (2) too much emphasis on the assessment of outcomes at the expense of an assessment of processes, which can result in a phenomenon that the author calls 'the institutionalisation of conformity'; (3) the asymmetry of accountability, i.e. the uneven distribution among different actors of the responsibility to account for actions, which can generate a reduced sense of fairness and legitimacy.","Klíčová slova: sociology of organisations, public sector, accountability, responsibility, new public management, EU-10"

In twondifferent samples (N = 856 and N = 840), the multi-group method revealed that egoistic, altruistic and biospheric values can be distinguished empirically in Hungary. Their findings suggest that Hungarians not only care for nature and the environment as such, but that these values are translated into feelings of moral obligation to protect the environment: biospheric values strongly helped to explain personal norms towards various environmental behaviours.

To address this gap in the literature, this research examines two measures of environmental concern, awareness of environmental threats and willingness to sacrifice, emphasising former state socialist countries both in comparison with countries around the globe and across countries located within this regional block. Results reveal that Central and Eastern European countries exhibit unique qualities regarding the content of environmental concern, and that, although the determinants of environmental threat awareness differ to some extent within this region, the social bases of willingness to sacrifice are strikingly similar across the six former state socialist countries in this sample.

The analysis reveals that values are more important for public behaviour and socio-demographics are more important for private behaviour. At the macro-level, an initial gap can be reported: Public and private behaviours were less frequent in the Czech Republic and also to a certain extent in East Germany.

First, the authors aim to analyse the factors that affect the intention of Czech consumers to purchase organic food using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Second, they employ an extended TPB model that introduces descriptive norms as an additional actor of behavioural intention. This study exploits data from a consumer survey of a sample of the Czech general adult population (N = 252) conducted in 2010. Structural equation modelling with an ML estimator is used to estimate model parameters. The empirical model derived from the TPB explains 44% of the variability of intention to purchase organic food. Descriptive norms are empirically distinct from injunctive norms and their inclusion in the model increases the explained variance of intention by an additional 5 percentage points. Attitudes and norms are the strongest predictors of the intention to purchase organic food, while perceived behavioural control has only a weak effect.","Klíčová slova: theory of planned behaviour, organic food consumption, structural equation modelling, descriptive norms, Czech Republic"

How these tendencies are reflected in the access to environmental benefits and exposure to environmental risks in the majority and the minority populations is the subject of this article. Using a comparative evaluation and the concept of environmental justice the author analyses the social processes and factors that contribute to differentiated distribution of risks/benefits. Based on a survey of 30 randomly selected settlements and comparative case study analyses the author maps inequalities, identifies the location of a Roma settlement as a strong factor leading to various forms of environmental (in)justice, and subjects the settlement locations to an entitlement analysis (as developed by Amartya Sen). Particular attention is paid to defining and understanding entitlements and how they govern access to land and thus influence the living conditions and well-being of different individuals and groups. Entitlements and the entitlement-based control of resources are discussed here as a dynamic process, the different economic and social factors behind which are identified and analysed to deconstruct the processes that lead to environmental (in)justice. The article concludes with a description of trends and a discussion of the need to re-think our definitions and understanding of the role of entitlements in relation to the distribution of environmental benefits and risks.","Klíčová slova: environmental justice, entitlement analysis, Roma ethnic minority, land use, environmental sociology, Slovakia"

To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).","Klíčová slova: narrative analysis, qualitative methodology, Ricoeur, mimesis, structuralism, hermeneutics, interactionism"

Alexander's cultural sociology. It shows that, in Alexander's work, the relative autonomy of culture is conceptualised in two different ways: first, as an analytical autonomy that is part of a multidimensional model of social action, and second, as the formal autonomy of a semiotic system that dominates in the more culturalist strand of Alexander's work. The author claims that Alexander's attempt to move in his work beyond a merely analytical autonomy of culture towards a fuller view of autonomy brings mixed results. Both concepts of the relative autonomy of culture assert an internal logic of culture, but the semiotic variant offers a much more developed account of what its internal structure is. However, the drawback of the semiotic view is that it tends towards the position of an absolute autonomy of culture or cultural idealism, which is difficult to reconcile with an adequate view of agency. The related proposal, first formulated by Anne Kane and endorsed by Alexander, to distinguish between the analytical and the concrete autonomy of culture is internally contradictory, for once culture becomes concretely enmeshed with social life, culture's autonomy dissolves. The central weakness of the concept of the autonomy of culture is identified as the insufficiently developed explication of the internal mechanism through which culture and action are linked. Social theory has to do more to combine an analytical conception of culture, situated within a multidimensional framework of action, with a semiotic view of cultural structures.","Klíčová slova: : cultural system, culture and agency, relative autonomy, cultural sociology, Jeffrey C.

The advantages of this class concept are that: (1) it does not rule out the possibility of the construction of a notion of home by members of this class; (2) it provides more information about social practices generally; (3) it focuses on the agent-individual, avoiding the reification of a homeless person in the form of a homogeneous group. Using the concepts of active agency and space-time the article aims to describe time-space mobility, everyday practices, and the production of places of the observed agents. This study draws on the theories of Pierre Bourdieu and Michel de Certeau and on the space-time theories of David Harvey, Thorsten Hägerstrand, and Michel Foucault. It works with ethnographic data and puts forth the idea that unlike dominant places, which are strategically produced and can be ascribed one dominant meaning and associated practice, in the case of tactically produced places there are always multiple meanings and thus a myriad of associated practices. These specific places are 'heterotopias'. The article describes the (re)production of one heterotopia and in doing so offers an empirically based conceptualisation of such a place.","Klíčová slova: homelessness, the poorest class, space-time, everyday practices, time-space mobility, heterotopias, urban revitalisation, spatial hierarchy"

Senate elections use a majority run-off system in single-member constituencies. First, the article describes the friends-and-neighbours effect, a process of electoral geography whereby voters prefer their own local candidate (i.e. a resident of the particular municipality or area) to opponents from geographically more distant localities. Second, the article examines the phenomenon of 'local voting' in elections to the Czech Senate. The analysis covers all electoral contests from 1996 to April 2011, including by-elections (except in the four largest cities by population owing to a methodological problem). The data file comprises a total of 1420 candidates and their election results at the municipal level aggregated to three geographically defined areas. It specifically examines differences in electoral support for a candidate in his/her home locality (municipality of residence), in a nearby neighbourhood up to 10 km away, and the rest of the constituency.

Although it is not easy to establish a firm definition of individualisation, most researchers studying demographic phenomena work with the concepts of differentiation and de-standardisation. If we understand individualisation as a structural fact and leave aside its subjective component (individualised identity is not necessary linked to structural changes), it must initially emerge on the aggregate level in the form of the differentiation of life courses or the different timing of transitions. For example, individuals begin to marry and have children at different ages. It then becomes apparent at the individual level in the form of the de-standardisation of the life course, thus not just as a change in timing, but also as a change in the order and realisation of individual transitions. For example, the birth of a child does not necessarily occur after marriage. So it is not just shifts in timing that are of interest - these have already been sufficiently studied in Czech demography - but also and above all the comparative distributions of these demographic phenomena. In this article the analysis works with two life transitions - marriage and first-order births - and using time series from 1920 to 2004 the authors examine the dispersion in timing of these transitions over a large segment of the 20th century. Using more detailed data from the post-1989 transformation period, in addition to dispersion the authors also examine changes in the intervals between marriages and births and education as a factor in the observed phenomena. As a key indicator of life-course differentiation they use the dispersion in marriage timing and its trend over the 20th century, and as an indicator of the de-standardisation of life courses in the 1990s they use the interval between marriage and first-order births.","Klíčová slova: birth timing, marriage timing, individualisation, life course"

Nešpor,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i., Praha","The article analyses the life and academic contribution of one of the most prominent interwar Czech sociologists, Jan Mertl (1904-1978), whose studies in political sociology studies were highly innovative in his day, in both the Czech and the international context. Mertl was a follower of Max Weber and focused on the comparative historical-sociological analysis of political partisanship and party systems. He also devoted extensive study to changes in the relationship between state administration/bureaucracy and political representation. He enriched the field of (Czech) sociological theory with his concept of the 'self-regularity of social phenomena', dealing with the unintended outcomes and latent functions of social action, and he attempted to distinguish between Weberian ideal types and 'historical types'. He also made the first systematic analysis of modern bureaucracy, using the Weberian concept of the 'iron cage of modernisation'. However, Mertl is a significant figure in the history of Czech sociology for another reason: his behaviour during the Second World War is generally perceived as an explicit example of collaboration with Nazism, which led to Mertl's total exclusion from the academic community after the war. The author analyses the motives and extent of Mertl's 'wrongdoing', as well as the reasons for his being ostracised by the academic world, even though he was officially acquitted of collaboration. The author also provides a brief description of his later life.

They postulate that the framing process creates conditions for the agenda-setting process and argue that differently framed news have different effects in the agenda-setting process. They hypothesise that issue-specific frames, episodic frames, and value frames have a stronger agenda-setting effect than generic frames, thematic frames, and strategy frames and suggest explaining the role of frames in the agenda-setting process through the theory of cognitive dissonance. The hypotheses are tested using matched panel survey data on respondents' personal agendas and using a content analysis of the media in relation to one particular issue. The selected issue - the restitution of property to the Catholic Church - was chosen because it contains a rich combination of frames. Moreover, this is an issue on which it is possible to study the effect of a 'focusing event', which may have an additional and distinct effect in addition to the 'regular' frames. The authors show that differently framed news do indeed have distinctive effects on personal agenda-setting. Some frames have a strong positive effect, while others have no effect. They even identify one frame that appears to have a slightly negative net effect on personal agenda-setting. This is a somewhat revolutionary finding, since it demonstrates that, unlike the predictions made by the agenda-setting theory, people may (under certain conditions) react to the heightened media exposure of an issue by denying its importance.","Klíčová slova: framing, agenda-setting, panel data, quantitative content analysis."

After introducing the concept of regeneration and regeneration theories and reviewing foreign cases of regeneration of problem neighbourhoods, the authors analyse the situation in Prague and attempt to answer three basic questions: How do the authorities in Prague approach social-spatial inequalities and urban regeneration in the city? What are the objectives of the city's regeneration policies and what tools are used? Who are the main actors involved in regeneration policies and how do they relate to each other? The study of documents and interviews with the people who are the actors involved in regeneration policies showed that the 'regeneration policies for problem neighbourhoods' in a post-socialist city differ significantly from the approaches applied in Western cities. In Prague regeneration policies do not rank high on the ladder of local political priorities, and local politicians implicitly assume that the situation in the city and its districts and neighbourhoods will improve, existing problems will be eliminated, and the city's inhabitants will see a rise in their economic and social status. A detailed analysis showed that the lack of emphasis placed on the regeneration of problem neighbourhoods is mainly due to structural factors. Socio-spatial inequalities in Prague are still smaller than in most otherwise comparable cities in the Western world, the spatial concentration of existing problems is not too great, and the spatial patterns of social and economic problems in the city do not overlap very much. Spatial concentrations of problems in Prague are thus far mainly found in a micro-local form, encompassing just individual buildings, clusters of buildings, or at most one to several blocks.","Klíčová slova: regeneration, residential neighbourhoods, post-socialist city."

Based on previous analyses and published work, the article formulates the hypothesis that the process of crystallisation of the two main ideologies or norms of distributive justice, namely meritocratic and egalitarian ideologies, which was confirmed in analyses carried out from 1991 to 1995, continued in later years. The article draws on the fundamental theories of distributive justice and utilises data from surveys carried out in 1991, 1995, 2006 and 2009, which the authors analyse in terms of measurement and structural models. The models confirm the hypothesis that the crystallisation of norms of distributive justice continued in more recent years, and that at present these norms are internally structured in almost the same way as in advanced democracies. These norms are thus closely tied to the stratification system, which means that meritocracy has solidified its position as the dominant norm of distributive justice, whereas egalitarianism has gradually become a 'challenging' norm preferred by individuals in lower-status positions in the stratification system.","Klíčová slova: distributive justice, legitimacy of inequality, meritocracy, redistribution, stratification, social transformation."

It puts forth analytical frames for understanding the ways in which the power and hegemony of modern Western medicine (biomedicine) are applied and negotiated in the field of human reproduction, and it proposes possible uses for such frames in the sociological study of Czech reproductive medicine. It deals mainly with biopower and biopolitics as analytical concepts pertaining to the control and administration of the modern population, governmentality, medicalisation, and authoritative knowledge. The article conceives biomedicine as a sign of the normalisation of modern society, identified with the Western concept of health and illness and the idea of technological progress, and subjects it to critical sociological analysis. It focuses on an analysis of reproductive medicine, a key sphere of biopower. In the context of biopower, analysis of the normative nature of reproductive medicine and its consequences in the wider social space is significant. Such consequences affect intimacy and sexuality, the institute of kinship, heteronormative reproduction, gender identities, and more. The authors' interest in this subject is motivated by the strong connections between reproductive medicine, technology, and the commodification of health and illness. The article also focuses on the methods that Czech sociology has used to date to study this topic. The authors aim to introduce a conceptual approach into Czech sociology of medicine and use it to analytically link the theme of biopower and reproductive medicine.","Klíčová slova: biopower, reproductive biomedicine, medicalization, DNA and embryo manipulation, assisted reproduction, childbirth."

It sets out to determine which age groups in society today have a stronger sense of identity and the source of that identity, while drawing on the tenets of social psychology and the theories of social identity and optimal distinctiveness. The latter two theories provide insight into the motives for identification with social groups, but see different needs at the heart of this identification, and thus offer alternative hypotheses of age as a source of status and positive self-image versus age as a source of distinctiveness and a 'substitute' source of identity. The analysis is based on representative data for the Czech population over the age of 20 drawn from the European Social Survey Round 4 and the International Social Survey Programme 2003. It shows that self-categorisation into the verbally defined age groups of young, middle-aged, and old is indeed common. It also reveals a much stronger level of peer group self-identification among the youngest and oldest respondents, despite the low social status of these age groups. The article closes with a discussion of the varying significance age has as a source of social identity and the invalidity of the hypothesis that age group identification is dependent on the social status of its members.","Klíčová slova: age, age identity, social identity, social status, ESS, ISSP, Czech Republic."

Setting out from the premise that the symbolic and artefactual nature of new media, their 'thingness', should be a central part of any investigation of their social and cultural signifi cance, the article focuses on the meaning of the mobile phone as a cultural object and commodity sign for various groups of users/consumers. It also concentrates on the social structuring of mobile phone use by young people and addresses the relationship between class and the practices and meanings of mobile phone use in the context of young people's consumption of other media and cultural technologies. It addresses one of the central questions in the sociology of culture-how are consumption tastes and practices related to class-and examines it through the case of mobile phone use. The study suggests that the general 'technosensibility' of young people, which seems a universal generational phenomenon, when interpreted in the context of the consumption of other 'old' and 'new' media and cultural consumption in general, is differentiated according to class and cultural capital. The article concludes that class distinctions produce a digital divide that results in two distinct populations of young users: the interacting and the interacted users.","Klíčová slova: mobile phone, young people, cultural capital, class, digital gap, expressive use/pragmatic use, Slovenia"

This article focuses on perceptions and constructions of sexual harassment by students and the gap between students' individual definitions and expert (mainly legislative) definitions of sexual harassment. The article centres on two main research questions: (1) how do students perceive sexual harassment (whether they construct sexual harassment as something they might encounter in everyday university life) and (2) what are the factors and dimensions that contribute to particular behaviour being labelled as sexual harassment? The study is based primarily on qualitative in-depth interviews with students, which are complemented by quantitative questionnaire data from a survey conducted between 2008 and 2009 at a Prague university. The analysis shows that even if sexual harassment by professors is not an uncommon phenomenon among students, it is constructed as a remote problem which students perceive as something that does not relate to them. Although students do not label their experience of sexist and sexualised behaviour as sexual harassment, the analysis reveals certain factors which result in the labelling of certain behaviour as sexual harassment.The most signifi cant among these factors were the explicit nature ofsexual harassment, power imbalance, situational context and the violation of individual boundaries.","Klíčová slova: sexual harassment, higher education, anti-harassment policy, Czech Republic"

The consequences of this widening gap in roles are increasingly evident, however, little is known about the intra-party foundations of this trend. This study using May's law and a theoretically informed case study of the Czech Christian Democratic Party (KDU-ČSL) demonstrates that (1) the opinion structure with a governance rather than representation oriented party is largely homogeneous revealing the origins of the representation deficit; and (2) the observed opinion differences among members of a party frequently in government have their origins in society rather than within the party showing that internal party life is failing in its representation function. These two results demonstrate that fundamental changes in party system have intra-party foundations.Keywords: representative versus responsible government, party members,May's Law, policy positions, Czech Christian Democratic Party","Klíčová slova: : representative versus responsible government, party members, May's Law, policy positions, Czech Christian Democratic Party"

The year 1989 is viewed as a major turning point, after which volunteering developed anew from scratch. This article is based on twelve interviews with current volunteers that focused on their interpretation of the volunteering experience before and after 1989. The article shows that volunteering pre- and post-1989 may be framed as part of a continuous story. Interpreting the year 1989 as a break in development and a new beginning is based on a specific definition of volunteering as a part of civil society. Any description of volunteering before 1989 involves agreeing on a definition of volunteering. Volunteers refer to 'hobby' and 'high-level' volunteering, a dichotomous definition that on the one hand enables (or disables) talk about volunteering before 1989 and on the other relates to current discussions about the essence (core) of volunteering and its social value.","Klíčová slova: volunteering, civil society, communism, discourse analysis."

The study conceives academic success and failure as categories that need to be explained; it is necessary to demonstrate how they are produced and ascribed with meaning in the everyday practice of student evaluation, especially by school authorities. Student evaluations are generally based on a complex assessment of a student's aptitude and diligence, and they also reflect a student's conduct at school conduct and attitude towards school discipline, education, and authority, i.e. towards accepted values, the school code, and other (written and unwritten) rules of interaction. Academic failure signalling some kind of shortcoming on the part of the recipient of an evaluation - be it a lack of interest, motivation, cooperation, effort, ability, or intelligence - has a moral connotation and stigmatising effect. This is legitimised by the presumption that it is the student's own deliberate actions, his or her degree of interest and effort, that determine success or failure at school, and that this essentially has nothing to do with the student's (natural) intelligence or (given) family background. Yet a student's family background and available cultural resources play an important role in academic performance. Academically inclined parents, high academic ambitions on the part of a student and his or her parents, communication style, and respect for school authority are key elements of success at basic school and have a hand in the intergenerational reproduction of educational inequalities.","Klíčová slova: school ethnography, social categorisation, school success/failure, educational inequalities, cultural resources, positioning."

The introduction contains a summary of the theoretical and empirical principles that SQWLI is based on. It describes the basic (micro-, mezzo-, and macro-) levels on which quality of working life can be measured and discusses the problem of the duality of social phenomena consisting in objective conditions and actors' subjective perception of them. Based on this concept, it identifies what the SQWLI is intended to capture, specifically, the micro-level aspect of how workers themselves subjectively perceive the quality of working life. The author then proceeds to describe the structure of the research instrument based on the attributes of working life that survey respondents assess in terms of their importance and in terms of their own satisfaction with them.

Using examples of the basic levels of analysis (aspects, domains, indices) the author also demonstrates how the validity and reliability of the instrument were tested. The article closes with a discussion that raises some question areas that under certain circumstances may make the application of the instrument problematic, in particular the question of the scope of the instrument, correlations between the dimensions of satisfaction and importance, and the possible applications of the instrument outside the large cross-sectional surveys for which it was primarily designed.","Klíčová slova: SQWL, subjective quality of working life, quality of working life, work satisfaction, life satisfaction."

Nešpor,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i., Praha","The article analyses the life story and works of a significant, but today sadly almost unknown, Czech sociologist, Jaroslav Šíma (1914-1955). It draws on all the published sources available on him as well as a large number of to date unknown and unexploited archive materials. Šíma became a member of the somewhat ""thin on the ground"" national sociological academia of the interwar period and specialised in the sociology of sexuality, religion, and education. However, his research was often the result of his own religious and church positions, which were connected with the so-called free Christianity movement and which cannot be accurately judged according to contemporary standards. Šíma's star rose spectacularly during the Second World War, when he became the undisputed leader of Czech sociology, notwithstanding the fact that his influence came at the price of making considerable compromises with the Nazi regime, and owing to this and his own personal failures he assumed a rather low profile in the immediate post-war years. Šíma had another opportunity to shine following the communist coup in 1948, when he immersed himself in the ideas of the new regime. Seven years later he committed suicide. The author analyses Šíma's fate and his writings as a case study in the context of the evolution of Czech sociology and outlines its weak points as well as the events which contributed to the outstanding but unlikely success of this 'maverick' of sociology (the discipline's weak organisational background, with conformity to special interests, personal grudges between top figures in the field, and methodological incompetence flourishing in its place).","Klíčová slova: Jaroslav Šíma, Czech sociology - 20th century, sociology and politics, sociology and power, sociology of religion."

It focuses primarily on the structure of authors and themes published in the journal, studied using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of text analysis. Some of the most productive contributors to Sociologická revue were the important Czech sociologists I. A. Bláha, E. Chalupný and J. L. Fischer and from abroad P. Sorokin. In terms of thematic structure, the majority of texts published in Sociologická revue focused on domestic and foreign sociology. Another prominent theme was the nation and nation-related issues, with texts devoted to the analysis of German fascism, national liberation struggles, and Czech-Slovak national co-existence. Broad thematic areas included the somewhat interrelated topics of crisis, rural areas, work, and politics and democracy. Texts devoted to the theme of crisis tended to focus on the period of the Great Depression, but crisis was also examined in a much broader than just economic sense. The theme of rural areas underwent a transformation over time and particularly after the war was replaced by the theme of folk and folk culture. The issue of work encompassed two themes: the working class and unemployment.","Klíčová slova: Sociologická revue, content analysis, Czech sociology, journals of sociology, structure of the authors, thematic structure."

They analyse the ways in which these localities are categorised and how these categorisations are used to legitimise the specific treatment of these places and their inhabitants. City governance and administration are considered to be a part of a modern tradition of urban planning and city management, which is analysed in the first part of the study. The second, empirical part shows how 'common sense', ethnicised attributes are activated and applied to the localities and their inhabitants in the narratives of politicians and public officials. These attributes are associated with a notion of impurity, which leads to the need for surveillance, discipline, or purifi cation. From their analysis of these narrative practices the authors suggest that the borders of entitlement and the borders of responsibility are constructed. The borders of entitlement define who deserves the care provided by a state or a city; the borders of responsibility then delimit the symbolic space in which the state or city is perceived by its representatives to be responsible for the situation of its inhabitants and citizens. A crucial role is played in the process of border formation by (1) the application of ethnicised categories and inconsistent definitions of the objects of municipal and state care and by (2) the forms of ownership that apply to the housing stock in which these objects, that is, people, live.","Klíčová slova: social exclusion, space, urbanism, purification, ethnicisation, local government and administration, qualitative research, Czech Republic."

The separation of the Roma from the majority occurs both in the social space and in the educational system through the existence of sub-standard, low-demanding basic schools, where the majority of students are Roma. Both spatial and educational exclusion have become the subject of public debate, policies, and, in the case of schools, of international legal disputes. In the article the authors ask what mechanisms lie behind the existence/functioning of 'Roma schools' in the vicinity of deprived urban enclaves with Roma populations. To answer this question they introduce the concept of ethnically segmented local education markets, which emerged in large cities after 1989. These markets interconnect deprived Roma localities with 'Roma schools' and are a part of the wider problem of the low social mobility of segregated urban Roma. The authors show that the ethnically segmented education market is shaped by three factors: (a) the spatial structure, (b) the institutional framework, including law and policy as well as schools, and (c) the educational strategies of both Roma and non-Roma parents. The data the authors used in the analysis came from the Czech part of an international quantitative and qualitative study in which more than 920 questionnaires were completed by students and teachers and 80 interviews were conducted with students, parents and teachers in two large Czech cities. For a better understanding of the authors' basic argument they chose just one segmented local market as an illustrative example.","Klíčová slova: social exclusion, Roma, education, socially excluded localities, reproduction of social and spatial inequality, education market, Czech Republic."

The article summarises some of the theoretical assumptions of developmental analyses of small rural communities, its development factors, and the current focus of contemporary Czech research. For many rural inhabitants their local community is the main space of everyday activity, and the development, stagnation, or decline of the community's functions or changes in its socioeconomic and cultural characteristics significantly impact the inhabitants' quality of life. However, searching for relevant developmental potential and, in particular, measuring the impact of such potential are complicated tasks because there is a lack of data for firm comparative analyses. This article aims to explore the internal structure of developmental potential and statistically measure its impact. Therefore, the author presents a model of local development consisting of structural and locality-based factors, endogenous developmental potential, and developmental indicators. The model is tested on a set of statistical data for individual small rural communities in the Czech Republic using factor analysis and multilevel modelling, where the regional data are used as independent variables on the second level. The empirical results confirm that it is possible to define several distinct types of endogenous developmental potential and to identify their impact on development, which is rather weak. The relatively high intra-class correlation coefficients of some community characteristics indicate the existence of specific regional patterns of community capacity and development in small rural communities in the Czech Republic.","Klíčová slova: endogenous developmental potential, community development, rural communities, small municipalities, community capacity, rural development, Czech Republic."

The authors argue that the persistent out-migration predominately of young and educated inhabitants is one of the key processes of the circular causal mechanism that leads to the marginalisation of particular localities and areas. Selective outmigration entails the disappearance of various socio-cultural activities, more precisely social institutions and civic amenities essential to maintaining or increasing the quality of human capital. Consequently, depopulation could have a severe impact on the developmental potential of a locality, and thus could significantly decrease quality of life in certain localities and particularly among certain social groups of the population. The article provides spatial insight into depopulation tendencies at several geographical levels, especially in the final decades of the last century. Alongside a quantitative analysis of migration, the research included a detailed case study of a municipality in the Pacov region and thus also applied qualitative approaches (e.g. observation, semi-structured interviews with the inhabitants, and local actors). The article discusses the interconnections between specific effects of depopulation (e.g. a deterioration of accessibility by public transport, poor civic amenities, ) and their impacts on the quality of life in rural peripheral areas in general.","Klíčová slova: quality of life, migration, depopulation, rural areas, Czech Republic."

Poor accessibility to micro-regional cores by public transport was used as the criterion to define municipalities as peripheral. Peripheral areas. Seven state-border, six county-border and nine intra-county peripheral areas were delimited in the South Bohemian region. Consequently, the authors monitored the differences between peripheral areas and their types and between peripheral municipalities, semi-peripheral municipalities, suburban municipalities and micro-regional cores (towns) on the basis of dissimilar values of defined indicators of social-population instability. Such differences are also explained in terms of the concept of spatially conditioned social exclusion. The authors defined and used some basic socio-economic indicators in their research: index of population development between 1971 and 2009 and between 1990 and 2009; proportion of the population in the age groups 0-14 and 65+ in 2009; rate of registered unemployment in 2009; proportion of the population with the secondary school-leaving examination in 2001; number of flats built per 1000 inhabitants between 2000 and 2008. Social-population instability was found mainly in county-border peripheral areas and also in a number of state-border peripheral areas. The authors also examined regional social policies for peripheral municipalities and peripheral areas. In the article's theoretical discussion, and to explain regional social policies for peripheral municipalities and areas, the authors draw on the concept of social exclusion and distinguish spatially unconditioned social exclusion and spatially conditioned social exclusion, which includes social exclusion that results from living in peripheral municipalities and areas.","Klíčová slova: peripheral areas, social stability, population stability, social indicators, social exclusion, rural development, Czech Republic."

Due to its soft/non-obligatory way of infl uencing policy, it is particularly interesting to investigate to what extent its potential is actually put to good use in member states and which factors determine whether member states actually achieve the Lisbon Strategy's goals. Bearing in mind the lack of empirical evidence for the OMC's infl uence on national education policies, and considering the theoretical assumptions of soft modes of governance, Europeanisation processes and policy learning, this article identifies the potential of the OMC, and analyses its (possible) impact on education policy in Slovenia. Here, the article limits itself to the lifelong learning policy and seeks to discover the extent to which the OMC's potential in this regard is taken advantage of in Slovenia. The article concludes that, although relatively good results are visible in National/EU Progress Reports, its full potential has not been exploited. The authors explain that good quantitative goals are achievable for member states even without respecting the qualitative goals related to good governance.

The authors used six different measures of child health-various constructs based on birth weight, length of gestation, and vitality-as dependent variables and the mother's educational attainment as the key predictor. They used birth certificate data on all singleton births in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2007 (N=912 591). They estimated a series of random-intercept multi-level models and report the observed trends in health inequality by maternal education. The analysis consistently and persistently showed large gaps in health between children born to mothers with elementary education on the one hand and all other children on the other hand. While the trends are not entirely congruent across all measures of child health, the authors found more evidence of growing inequality than of declining or stable inequality.

This article introduces a research project that focused on teenagers and their leisure-time activities, concentrating especially on teenagers who spend the majority of their leisure time in shopping malls. The goal of the article is to reveal how such teenagers use the micro-space of the shopping mall, how they socialise, and how their social identities may be produced through different practices in the mall space. The study focused on teenagers aged 14-17 'hanging out' in shopping malls in the largest Czech cities. The data were collected by participant observation and interviews. The teenagers studied have abandoned typical public spaces used for leisure time and produced their own spatial identities in the specific space of the shopping mall. They have created a true microculture through a combination of the personalities, locations, and events that they share in in the mall environment. The article also discusses interesting results concerning preference factors for leisure time activities in the mall environment. The concluding part of the article draws implications from the study for the future research agenda in the geographies and sociologies of youth.","Klíčová slova: teenagers, hanging out, spatial microculture, geography of children and youth, shopping mall, Czech Republic"

To begin with, four functions of liberal democracy are distinguished: securing international peace, guaranteeing legal as well as political peace domestically, and producing good active citizens. The following part of the argument distinguishes four structural features characteristic of democratic regimes: stateness, rule of law, political competition, and accountability of the rulers. Thirdly, a brief summary of critical accounts concerning democracy's actual failures and symptoms of malfunctioning is presented. In the final section, two families of institutional innovations that are currently being proposed as remedies for the observed deficiencies of democracy are explored: those leading to a better aggregation of given preferences of the citizens and those aimed at improving the process of preference formation itself. It is the latter, which constitutes the field of deliberative politics that is investigated at some length. Beneficial effects of deliberative procedures and essential features of deliberative structures are discussed with reference to latest developments in the theory and empirical research on deliberative democracy.","Klíčová slova: theory of democracy, liberal democracy, deliberative politics, crisis of democracy, institutional design"

The authors use a series of 28 annual surveys conducted between 1990 and 2009 in the Czech Republic and ascertaining information about the level of education of the respondent and the respondent's father. The authors analyse trends in educational fluidity from a period and birth cohort perspective. The findings show that educational fluidity did not increase in Czech society between 1990 and 2003. From 2004 to 2009 this trend changed and a slight increase in educational fluidity became evident. These changes in educational fluidity are driven by period (by institutional changes) rather than cohort effects (by cohort replacement). Period effect signifies both changes in the effect of class origin on educational attainment (class inequalities in education) and changes in the expansion of the Czech educational system. Both these period effects are presented as a part of the theory of maximally maintained inequality (MMI), which helps explain the changes in educational fluidity in the Czech Republic during the observed period.","Klíčová slova: educational mobility, cohort analysis, educational inequality, educational research, measures of inequality."

The article addresses the following questions: How are individual political parties represented? How much are electoral decisions influenced by the political party and how much by who the individual candidate is? What is the difference in the success rate of individual parties in the first and runoff election rounds? Which parties benefited from this electoral system and which are disadvantaged by it? Does the majority runoff system have a curbing effect on the representation of extremist parties? How does the personality of the candidate contribute to an election outcome? The article analyses the results of seven Senate elections between 1996 and 2008. The data file for the analysis includes all the candidates who ran for the Senate during this period (a total of 1685 candidates). The results of the analysis are contrasted with existing theoretical assumptions about the impact of the majority runoff system and in particular Duverger's laws.,"Klíčová slova: electoral behaviour, party representation, majority runoff system."

This article aims to study how spatial exclusion and involuntary residential segregation 'function', that is, how they operate on the social micro level as a 'generator' of social and economic disadvantage. Certain types of objective obstacles arise in the living environment of excluded people and they continuously have to overcome these obstacles on an everyday basis. The author analyses how spatial exclusion acts on the excluded by requiring relatively high expenditures of money and time for them to overcome exclusion. He then examines the infrastructural dimensions of spatial exclusion, describing infrastructural exclusion as a dimension of disadvantage in which the excluded have limited access to infrastructures and through them resources otherwise commonly accessible in the dominant socio-economic system. Access to these infrastructures and resources can be regarded as an indicator of social integration and as an essential precondition for equal and meaningful social and economic participation in the life of the dominant socio-economic system. In conclusion, the author discusses the conflicting or almost contradictory relationship between the generation of spatial and infrastructural exclusion on the one hand and social integration projects on the other.","Klíčová slova: social exclusion, spatial exclusion, infrastructural exclusion, segregation, Roma, Gypsies."

The analyses show that Czech women are more religious than Czech men in every measure of religiosity, but do not indicate that these differences can be explained by economic activity or social deprivation measured as a subjective assessment of social status.

This article summarises the discussions concerning the countermovement phenomenon in the last thirty years. The starting point of the interest in countermovements of different kinds in the Western context is generally considered to lie in the 1970s and the 1980s, when the opposition to the reform movements of the preceding period became more intense. In an attempt to define this phenomenon, sociology made use of its theoretical and methodological apparatus available at that time. Therefore, resource mobilization theory, the political opportunities/ political process model, and framing theory gradually looked at countermovements from different points of view and concentrated on different parts of their life cycle. This article first discusses various countermovement definitions and dilemmas which sociologists have faced in their analysis. It then focuses on the key dimensions of the countermovement life cycle: its genesis and mobilization, strategy and tactics, and its potential effects. Emphasis is placed on the comparison of different theoretical and methodological approaches and the dynamic movement-countermovement relationship. The topics are illustrated on examples from relevant case studies. The conclusion summarises the areas to which the social sciences, in analysing the problems of countermovements, pay very little attention.","Klíčová slova: social movements, countermovements, conservative movements, countermovement mobilization, countermovement strategies, countermovement effects, political opportunity structure, resource mobilization, framing."

The research was carried out in 2008-2009 on a sample of 832 students at 11 public universities and colleges. The results indicate that 78% of students have personally experienced teacher behaviours that can be characterised as sexual harassment. However, only 3% of them said explicitly that they had been sexually harassed. One of the reasons for this contradiction is the relatively low awareness about sexual harassment in Czech society. Even in academic debates, a narrow definition of sexual harassment is often preferred and the gender dimension of the problem is not considered. With this in mind, the authors discuss expanding the concept of 'sexual harassment' to include a gender perspective. They demonstrate the use of this concept in an academic setting and the outline main methodological challenges faced by the relevant research. Against this backdrop, they identify two contentious aspects of the conceptualisation of sexual harassment: (1) the relationship between 'objective' and 'subjective' definitions and (2) the relationship between expert and personal definitions (scientific and lay's definitions).","Klíčová slova: sexual harassment, gender harassment, universities, objective and subjective definition, expert and personal definition."

Using valence theory this article explores the differential turnout in terms of the expected benefits of voting for a party on the basis of valence and policy considerations. This individual-level analysis of electoral participation employs four post-election surveys and uses an alternative operationalisation of the expected benefits of voting, which makes it possible to conduct cross-national and cross-time comparisons. The results presented in the article demonstrate that change in voter turnout across general elections stems from the change in the expected benefits from voting aggregated at the level of the electorate. One key implication of this research is that attempts to facilitate increased electoral participation through institutional reform are unlikely to be successful. This is because turnout is primarily determined by voter motivation. Increased turnout depends critically on ensuring a level of party choice that gives voters an incentive to go the polls.","Klíčová slova: turnout, abstention, valence politics, Czech Republic."

While many Western countries have been experiencing declining or stable associations between class and electoral choice, we hypothesize that the trend in class voting should be quite different in the Czech Republic, and by extension, in other post-communist countries. We theorize that if a country is undergoing a process of re-stratification - the process in which class-based cleavages and identities regain significance in a new market economy after a long period of their de-stratification by communist egalitarian policies - such a country should also experience increases in class voting in the new market environment. Using standard loglinear and logistic regression approaches, our analysis confirms that class voting has indeed increased in the Czech Republic, particularly from 1998-2010. That increase is large both in the gross effect of class as well as its effect net of the role of other demographic variables. The Czech Republic is therefore relatively unique among countries examined in the international literature on class voting in having increasing associations across several electoral periods.","Klíčová slova: class voting, class politics, social stratification, politics in the Czech Republic."

Mapping the policy space traces these relationships and helps to answer the question: What are the positions of political parties on the selected political topics?

On the other hand, it questions the simplifying theory of ODS as a party of 'economists' and on the contrary shows that its success depended not so much on its economic vision as on the existence of an important group of post-normalisation 'technocrats', who after 1989 provided an anchoring for this vision among Czech regional elites. Their crucial support for professional party organisation stemmed from the absence of any other method of self-legitimisation, something which, by contrast, former dissidents were able to rely on, as were defenders of the model of political organisation that did not envision the existence of other political parties.","Klíčová slova: Civic Democratic Party, Civic Forum, political parties, Czech Republic."

An assessment of the extent of their overall ability to influence society's development requires a division into three spheres: business, employment relations, and the state budget. Strength in one sphere is found to influence strength in others. The development of collective bargaining in workplaces and at the sectoral level took shape relatively early. Forms of political influence developed more gradually, by a learning process, to include a combination of participation in tripartite structures, organising mass protest demonstrations and lobbying MPs and ministers. The relative weights of these elements, and their effectiveness, have varied with different governments and balances of power in parliament.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, trade unions, labour relations, tripartism"

In discussions on the Western GJM it is possible to distinguish two main perspectives on the movement's evolution, which were formulated in different contexts. One view claims that no such single movement exists anymore; it has already declined (or 'spilled out' into different field of activism). The other view argues that the movement is undergoing profound changes but its major principles and identity - at least latently - have survived. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it strives to re-introduce the concepts of 'spillover' and 'spillout' as multidimensional social processes and operationalise them to apply to the evolution of the Czech GJM in 2003-2009. Second, the article empirically traces the thematic shift of the Czech GJM towards anti-war activism and demonstrates that it is the movement's collective identity that constitutes a key obstacle to its spillout in an unfavourable environment.","Klíčová slova: contentious politics, collective identity, social movement spillover, global justice movement, anti-war activism, Czech Republic"

However, unlike in Western Europe, this did not occur as a result of pressure from civil society and the feminist movement. While attempting to explain the continuity and change of abortion institutions in the former Czechoslovakia /Czech Republic, the article focuses on the framing of the debates that preceded the changes in abortion legislation in the Czech Republic since the 1950s. Discourse analysis of media and expert articles, parliamentary debates, and other documents shows that abortion in the Czech Republic was framed as a medical issue since the 1950s, not an issue of women's rights or bodily citizenship. Gynaecologists were the most important actors in the abortion debates. The effect of this medicalised discourse of abortion was the construction of a specific knowledge on abortion. In spite of existing alternative discourses, this original discourse now hinders the possibility of reframing abortion in terms of women's reproductive rights and this is reflected in the status quo of the abortion legislation. The continuity of dominant discourse therefore reflects and reinforces the path-dependency of the institutions.","Klíčová slova: abortion policy, body discourse, frame analysis, discursive institutionalism, Czech Republic"

Proselyting is analysed as an instructed action and as a situation in which one party is initially aware of the category of encounter which is to take place, while the other party (or parties) is not, and it is necessary to create the particular type of encounter and then to execute it in some effective and beneficial way as defined by the first party. I examine the types of order to which both parties orient in these situations, i.e. local and extended sequential order, topical order, and categorial order, as they are layered in the doing of the instructed action. The findings demonstrate that, as opposed to the lay perception that religious missionaries simply recite learned passages and phrases in doing their proselyting work, their activities in fact involve complex sequences of communicative work which require the utilisation of experience, tacit knowledge, and creativity. In addition, while it is possible to flesh out and describe a clear sequence of phases in FCPP encounters which, from the outsider's perspective, constitute proselyting, there is little which otherwise differentiates it from other types of activities involving talk.","Klíčová slova: missionaries, LDS Church, instructed actions, proselyting, ethnomethodology, conversation analysis"

If quality evaluation focuses solely on sampling error, most aspects of data quality are ignored and surveys are assumed to have 'ideal' statistical characteristics that are rarely attainable in the pragmatic world of survey fieldwork. A complex overview of the entire process of data collection provides a more solid foundation for evaluating data quality. Under this approach, quality is ensured by controlling the whole survey process. Accuracy, which is commonly elaborated using the concept of survey error, ceases to be the only dimension of quality. Nevertheless, this data quality component is crucial for data analysis and statistical testing. A comprehensive approach to survey data quality requires us to take account of complex sample designs when evaluating sampling error and to identify and distinguish between different dimensions of nonsampling error. Analysts who are not directly involved in data collection have limited ability to obtain information necessary for data quality evaluation. There are two types of quality standards: administratively imposed standards (ISO20252:2006) and the technical and ethical criteria of professional associations (e.g. ICC/ESOMAR, AAPOR/WAPOR, SIMAR). These help break this information barrier between data producers and data users.","Klíčová slova: survey research methods, survey accuracy, total survey error, quality standards"

The life-time learning model devised by the American sociologists Mishler and Rose, who combine cultural and institutional approaches to explain trust in institutions, was used as the theoretical framework for this investigation. Logistic regression models were created for each of the observed institutions. The data used to build the models were drawn from a series of surveys conducted under the 'Czech Society' project by the Public Opinion Research Centre at the Institute of Sociology of the Academy of Sciences. The results of the logistic regression analyses showed that the particular level of trust in an institutions is infl uenced more by institutional performance (and this influence most pronounced in the case of the Government and the Chamber of Deputies) than by the effect of socialisation within the predominant political culture, which was not very strong. Nevertheless, the effect of culturally dependent variables such as gender and religious confession is not negligible.","Klíčová slova: : trust in institutions, political institutions, logistic regression, lifetime learning model, Czech Republic."

Even the large political parties do have enough members to put together candidate lists in most municipalities without the help of candidates not affiliated to any political party. This article demonstrates the cogency of distinguishing between two types of non-party politicians. First, there are politicians (candidates, councillors) who are not members of any political party but take advantage of the opportunity to run for them. Second, there are independents who run either independently or on the candidate lists of associations of independent candidates. While similar in many respects, there are also important differences between the two. Independents are more frequently women and people who before November 1989 were not members of the Communist Party. Compared to political party members, non-members are often elected on the basis of preference votes, but have smaller ambitions and often do not stand for re-election. A new finding is that a not insignificant number of political party members began their political career as independents, before joining a political party. The article draws on data from the international survey Municipal Assemblies in European Local Governance (MAELG), which concentrates on the recruitment, political careers, values, attitudes and working conditions of councillors in municipalities with a population over 10 000 inhabitants. In view of the importance of the size of the municipality, the Czech survey was expanded to include councillors from municipalities with a population between 3000 and 10 000 inhabitants.","Klíčová slova: local government, Czech Republic, political party members, independents, independent lists, members of assemblies, local elections, municipality size."

He found that people with narcissistic characteristics more often occupy socio-professional positions that place high demands on self-presentation, which means on appearance and demeanour. People with narcissistic characteristics also tend to seek out such professions more often. The interest in obtaining jobs that place high demands on self-presentation is more strongly associated with non-clinical narcissism than with whether or not the individual currently occupies such a position. Respondents with narcissistic characteristics also more often profess better chances of succeeding in such a position. People with narcissistic characteristics typically communicate on two typical levels: ego-confirmative and negotiative. Narcissistic types generally use communication primarily as a means of presenting their idealised Self (ego-confirmative level). However, when respondents who scored as narcissists in the test enter an interaction from which only one side can profit (negotiative comunication), they defend only their own interests and pay little attention to the needs of others. Narcissistic types also exhibit a higher level of self-control, which some criminologists associate with delinquency.","Klíčová slova: Non-clinical narcissism, profession, self-presentation, communication, human relations, self-control."

The field of governmentality studies is based on Michel Foucault's analyses of social power and the technologies of power, which in later writings he applied to liberal government and liberal notions of social control. This perspective provides better insight into contemporary neoliberal technologies of social control and the related technology of social control in general, examples of which in various social sectors are then provided by the authors in the article. The education sector must also be understood in the context of neoliberal governmentality, which casts in a new light many educational strategies that are generally accepted without question. The strategy of lifelong education must then be released from its representation as a natural right and instead included among the strategies of social coercion and domination directed at the inter-institutionalisation of education. Equally, it is also possible to expose debunk the skills-based concept of 'enterprise curriculum' that blurs the difference between general and professional education as a neoliberal power strategy. The results of the failure to apply this perspective to the education sector are the unchallenged ideologisation of contemporary education discourse and the formation of educational strategies that generate many undesirable consequences.","Klíčová slova: governmentality studies, neoliberalism, self-entrepreneur, enterprise curriculum, lifelong learning."

A corpus retrieved from an internet forum biased towards right-wing framings of political issues furnished this study with a means to focus on an 'inter-discursive' contestation taking place within a debate setting characterised by an asymmetric representation of opposing viewpoints. Entries criticising and entries defending agricultural subsidies and/or farmers were juxtaposed and analysed as culturally adroit performances of the social role of a representative of a local majority or minority opinion. The paper provides an elucidation of the unequal demands on representation of these diverse positions and clarifies the effects of some frequently employed discursive strategies, which bolster both the persuasiveness of the promoted interpretation and the positioning of the represented discourse on the battlefield of gaining/maintaining discursive dominance. It is argued and shown that the position of local dominance vs. subordination is not a matter only of numerical prevalence, but also (and perhaps primarily) of the interactional co-production of respective positions and of the discursive accomplishment of corresponding social roles.","Klíčová slova: discourse analysis, ethnomethodology, media, online discussions, discursive strategies, agriculture, subsidies."

The aim is to understand the way in which reporters and their colleagues 'make the news'. Ethnomethodologically informed ethnography is used to analyse cooperation among TV professionals and make visible the everyday, routine, and situated practices with which they perform their tasks. The authors study how practitioners perform their work in consideration of their colleagues' work, that is, with an awareness of a common aim. They argue that the professional system of relevances of newsmakers is structured by socially established and shared knowledge of the genre specifics of television news reports. The authors describe the genre structure of a standard television news report from a praxeological perspective, and they show how reporters, camera operators, sound technicians, editors, and others mutually collaborate to create a shared understanding of the system of genre norms. The article devotes particular attention to a key component of reporting work: the organisation and filming of interviews with respondents. The analysis demonstrates that interviews with respondents function as an auxiliary television news genre and that the system of relevances in this case is derived from the television news report as a superordinate genre.","Klíčová slova: television news, communicative genre, work practice, Czech Television, public service broadcasting."

The analysis shows how members reconstruct the rules of the training of guide dogs at a particular guide dog training centre (SVVP), and, while acting, how they orient themselves towards the principles of the broader framework, namely, the 'institution of the guide dog'. The participation of the dogs in these interactions is also considered. The use of the rules and the principles is interpreted through the concepts of positioning (Harré, Davies), claiming (Bottero, Irwin), and, in general, the framework of the ethnomethodological respecification of the concept of organisation, that is, 'organisation-in-action'. The article demonstrates how the image of the professional charitable client-orientated organisation is constructed in situ, and how the positions of the guide dogs and the visually impaired are presented by particular speakers. It also reveals that telling moral stories is one of the most frequently used ethnomethods of self-presentation, and that the positions and the claims of the actors are constructed in two main contexts: visual impairment and the 'dog companion culture'.","Klíčová slova: ethnomethods, positioning, claiming, organisation, institution, human-animal relationship, visually impaired."

The study of human affairs is conceived as a sequence of three types of choices - search, hermeneutic, and presentation choice - in order to guarantee that such study become a responsible strategic and epistemological game.

The argument of this article is that state interventions affecting property restitution, the protection of tenants, rent regulation, and the relative subsidisation of individual housing tenures are crucial factors infl uencing the perception and significance of private renting in the Czech Republic. At the beginning of the transition there was a universe of options: the private rental sector could evolve into a stable and significant tenure or into a weak, volatile, and residual type of housing. The particular rules of the game - state regulations - led to the quick supply of new private rental dwellings, but at the same time they substantially constrained the long-term demand for this type of housing. Like in those advanced countries where a more dramatic form of private rental housing liberalisation occurred, in the Czech Republic the significance of rental housing quickly shifted to become a temporary and residual form of housing. This article is thus about the 'greenfield' establishment of a housing system and how initial state regulations create or modify the long-term social norms relating to housing tenures and especially to private rental housing tenure.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, housing system, private rental housing, transition economies, housing theory"

Evidence from the Czech Republic,"Pat Lyons, Lukáš Linek","Institute of Sociology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague","National rather than regional party systems are the norm in most democratic states. This has been interpreted as meaning that most voters view inter-party competition in the same way. With a high level of party system nationalisation the relative proportion of electoral support attracted by parties across all constituencies tends to be very similar although the absolute level of party support changes across elections. Sociological and institutional explanations have been used to account for party system nationalisation. Both of these explanations have generally made causal inferences using aggregate data. The link between party system nationalisation and the individual voter has not been examined in the same detail. Here this link is explored using an ecological inference analysis of vote switching. This research, using the Czech Republic as a case study, shows that the presence of high party system nationalisation evident across a pair of elections may be associated with nonuniform electoral swings. These results demonstrate that evidence of party system nationalisation should not be taken to mean that all voters view electoral choices in the same way.","Klíčová slova: party system nationalisation, vote switching, ecological inference, Czech Republic"

Because greater fatalism lowers an employee's effort level, it may result in lower wages, while the anti-fatalistic attitude translates into more effective work that in turn may be rewarded with a higher salary. In this article the author tests a self-confidence scale that is similar to the most widely used Rotter locus of control scale. People with high self-confidence have determination, feel they have an influence on their future, and are optimistic.

It aims (1) to provide an empirical analysis of change in the heterogeneity of early family trajectories between the ages of 18 and 35 and (2) to identify their distinct patterns. To do this an entropy index and optimal matching analysis is applied. The paper uses data from the ISSP 2002, which included questions on partnership and family history in the Czech Republic. The findings show that the process of de-standardisation is quite complex and non-uniform. Cohorts born from the 1970s on experience more diverse early family trajectories than older cohorts, mainly due to increasing unmarried cohabitation. However, in the cohort born in the 1980s we can observe a reversal trend of declining diversity of family statuses in the subjects' early twenties due to the postponement of family related transitions. Even among older birth cohorts, who experienced their family starts under the socialist regime, it is possible to find a certain plurality of family starts, differentiated by the level of education.","Klíčová slova: life course de-standardisation, family trajectory, sequence analysis, ISSP 2002, Czech Republic"

This article concentrates on the circumstances that make IPV incidents more likely to be reported to the police, and it also analyses the reasons for victims' not reporting and for their distrust of the police. It makes use of data from the Czech part of the International Violence Against Women Survey, which allows us to analyse the reporting behaviour of 709 female victims of IPV. The reporting rate among them is very low - only 8%. Logistic regression models of reporting confirmed the high relevance of the features of the particular incident and revealed also several factors related to the history of violence in the relationship; on the other hand, the victim's resources were found to have no influence. Distrust of the police proved to be an important factor for not reporting to the police (29% of women), and further analysis of this factor suggested the possible occurrence of learned helplessness syndrome among some victims. An additional substantial outcome of this study is its highlighting of the importance of different forms of psychological abuse (threats vs. control) which have diverse effects on victims' reporting behaviour.","Klíčová slova: intimate partner violence, victim reporting behaviour, International Violence Against Women Survey, Czech Republic"

The Czech education system is also highly stratified, and student tracking begins at a young age. In this respect the most controversial element in the system are the multi-year gymnasia, the existence of which is nonetheless strongly supported by the public. This support is based on the conviction that multi-year gymnasia provide the most talented students with a good education, enable more rapid cognitive development for these students, and thus help cultivate Czech elites.

Based on ethnographic studies of two centres offering leisure activities for seniors (mainly using participant observation and in-depth and informal interviews with clients and employees), the article shows 1) how the idea of active ageing and generally of being active as an desirable or undesirable lifestyle in old age is constructed in the framework of the centre's general operations, and 2) how the clients themselves relate to this idea. The objective of the article is to reveal the significance of active ageing in the formation of a normative image of 'ageing well', which on the one hand helps seniors break away from stereotypical notions of ageing, but on the other hand generates new inequalities based on the ability or willingness to 'age actively'.",Klíčová slova: active ageing discourse; activity; ageing; ethnography; leisure; lifestyle in old age.

However, this implicitly assumed biogenetic basis of membership in a particular descent group is not evident in the case of kinship among inhabitants of a Roma settlement. The nature of their kinship can be described as the incorporative process of women and pristašis into descent groups. The fundamental criterion for an expectant partner in marriage is to be 'lačhe' (good, proper, appropriate). The division of people in a Roma settlement into two basic groups (lačhe versus degešis) does not mean that these people form endogamous groups defined by procreation. It is rather a matter of moral ideas about what makes people good or bad. Two complementary principles play an important role in these ideas. The first principle relates to the natural base, the second to the process of socialisation. In this respect, fajta does not just refer to a cognatic descent group, but also has another dimension, which cannot simply be defined in terms of procreation and which indicates a shift towards a common basis. This can be demonstrated in the example of pristašis, which is a long-term process of incorporation in which fajta, as the domain of nature, shifts to the frame of culture. Despite of the difficulty of determining whether people were born or socialised into a particular fajta, kinship in a Roma settlement should be studied within the wider organisational complex that on the one hand makes some people related and homogenous and on the other hand excludes other people from this relatedness.","Klíčová slova: Roma, Roma settlements, kinship, cognatic descent groups, nature, culture, Slovakia."

The sociology of youth has traditionally operated from two distinct perspectives concerned with either 'youth transitions' or 'youth (sub)cultures'. This polarisation has led to the neglect of the experience of mainstream youth, who cannot be easily pigeon-holed into the above categories. Drawing on a series of focus groups and small-group semi-structured interviews with 61 young people, the authors analysed young people's experience of consumption in the Czech Republic. Using the experience of young consumers, the research attempted to understand what it means to belong to the mainstream. The results indicate that belonging to the mainstream does not imply straightforward compliance with dominant power structures, but rather reflects a degree of reflexivity in which young people challenge stereotypes of passive conformism in complex and often paradoxical ways that are not yet well accounted for in the literature. The article suggests that the notion of 'mainstream youth' offers some potential as a conceptual way of understanding young people's relationship to social change in what appears to be an increasingly individualised society. At the same time, this notion provides an alternative approach that challenges many of the assumptions underpinning the sociology of youth's conception of consumption.","Klíčová slova: mainstream youth, cultural and structural approach, individualisation, consumption, brands, conformity, negotiation, focus groups."

First, the article sets out to determine whether during the transformation period significant differentiation of housing consumption occurred and social stratification became linked to stratification by housing consumption. In other words, whether alongside the 'standard' criteria (age, education, income, and other socio-economic variables) influencing the stratification of Czech households it is also necessary to take into account the type and quality of housing. Second, in relation to these findings on stratification, Czech households are segmented into 12 segments. The article then makes some general prognoses for each household segment regarding the number of households in selected forms of housing and types of housing development for 2020. These prognoses showed that if 'optimistic' outlooks for economic development are met and Czech citizens' housing preferences remain constant, there could be a substantial increase compared to today in the share of Czech households living in family homes and even to a certain excess of supply of rental flats over demand.","Klíčová slova: housing, consumption, housing classes, segmentation, prognoses, Czech Republic."

Using the dataset Sonda Maturant 1998, the authors show that entrance exams based on general aptitude tests may outperform the field-specific knowledge model in terms of providing access to talented students from a lower socioeconomic background. The simulations show that under the general aptitude regime the relative chances of an applicant with a university-educated father are only one-quarter higher than the relative chances of a student with a less educated father, compared to more than a one-third difference in the case of the regime emphasising field-specific knowledge.

The analytical framework used for this research is life course theory, according to which it is possible to approach the transition from youth to adulthood as a multiple transition. This point corresponds well with reality because young people follow at least three trajectories on their way to adulthood: from school to work, from family of origin to family of procreation, and from dependence to independence. The data necessary for the analysis were collected through repeated biographical and semi-structured interviews with 14 long-term unemployed graduates of non-GCSE vocational programmes and 6 employed graduates of vocational programmes as a reference group. Their implicit theories of adulthood, progress on the path to adulthood, and everyday strategies were examined in a qualitative data analysis, with special attention paid to contextual aspects. As for the dominant form of transition, the author found that long-term unemployment has a delaying impact on the transition to adulthood, above all owing to financial strain. These people suffer from prolonged economical dependency on their parents and remain at the threshold of the socially constructed path to adulthood. Typically there social status is vague.","Klíčová slova: transition to adulthood, long-term unemployment, graduates of vocational programmes, life course theory, Czech Republic."

The author developed a scale based on a definition from the American Psychiatric Association (DSM IV-TR) and it is intended for use in standardised sociological surveys of non-clinical populations. The author tested it in two surveys: a pilot survey (N=141, snowball sampling) and in a representative survey of the Czech Republic (N=1081, quota sampling). The resulting parameters (17 items, the common factor exhausts 47% of the variance, Cronbach's alfa = 0,926) indicate that the test is more reliable than other instruments used to date (NPI, NPI-16) and owing to its smaller scope is also easy to use in questionnaire surveys. Intensive questioning confirmed the scale's validity and produced results that correspond with the findings of psychologists focusing on this issue. The author inductively arrived at an auxiliary typology of narcissism. In the text he distinguishes between voluntary and involuntary narcissists, the characteristics of which are described in literature published to date. The findings presented in the article support the view of cognitive psychologists (e.g. J. Beck) who interpret narcissism as a 'defective cognitive scheme'. However, given the scope of the phenomenon measured in the Czech Republic (narcissistic features can be observed approximately from the eighth decile), narcissism cannot still be viewed as just a marginal and pathological phenomenon. On the contrary, it is necessary to approach it as a phenomenon that has a strong social aspect and also plays a significant role in how modern society functions. In the Czech population narcissistic features are most often observed among the young generation (aged 18-29), childless, singles and people living in communities with more than 5000 inhabitants. As well as identifying narcissism as a socio-cultural phenomenon the article also demonstrates the relationship between the observed phenomenon and homosexuality.","Klíčová slova: narcissism, scale, social changes, culture, identity, homosexuality."

This is because the results of spatial analyses of roll-call data from the United States are interpreted in terms of ideological preferences. Within Europe party discipline is also a central feature of legislator behaviour. Consequently, spatial models of roll call behaviour in European legislatures should be explained in terms of party cohesion and discipline. This means that the correct interpretation of spatial models of roll-call data in places such as the Czech Republic requires access to additional sources of empirical evidence such as parliamentary survey data in order to make valid and reliable inferences about what motivates legislative behaviour. Using roll-call and parliamentary survey data from the sixth legislature in the Czech Republic (2006-2008), this research demonstrates that spatial models of roll-call data are not readily explainable in terms of party cohesion and discipline. The difficulty of making a substantive interpretation of dimensions extracted suggests the use of spatial models of roll-call voting where part discipline is strong requires more theoretical and methodological work.","Klíčová slova: roll-call voting, spatial models, legislative behaviour, Czech Republic"

An analysis of national data suggests that improving housing affordability might be a factor behind the rise of fertility that has been observed since the beginning of the 2000s. The regional variation in fertility is generally lower than the regional variation of indicators of both housing affordability and the economic situation. Although the number of children born increased noticeably, total fertility did not increase at the same pace, and its regional patterns remained rather stable. The most important factor that influences the regional variation in fertility is the education of women, particularly young women. When the education of women is controlled for, housing affordability plays an important role in explaining the regional variation in fertility - both the total fertility rate and the timing of childbearing.","Klíčová slova: housing affordability, fertility, Czech regions"

The authors, however, challenge both of these characteristics. Czechs might better be considered unchurched than atheist, with various forms of modern New Age spirituality steadily gaining in popularity. Moreover, their reputation for irreligiosity is somewhat questionable, since it is most often based upon communist (and other more historically deep-rooted) anticlerical notions, while people have little real knowledge of the ideas which they so readily reject. These assertions are based both on quantitative data, provided by census returns and ISSP surveys on religion, and on qualitative data, collected in local ethnographic research in the town of Česka Lipa in northern Bohemia, designed along the lines of the Lancaster University Kendal Project in Great Britain. The Czech population can be divided into three 'blocks', religionists, spiritualists, and atheists/unbelievers, none of which, however, can be considered uniform in terms of membership or truly mutually exclusive. The authors conclude that traditional religionists of various denominations, the followers of New Age movements, and the 'rest' of the population can be seen as three distinctive groups within society and that mutual understanding and acceptance are by no means the norm.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, 1993-, religion, spirituality, atheism, post-communism, sociology of religion"

The results of the analysis reveal the existence of two kinds of social networks: one based on patron-client relations, and another based on equal and 'floating' partnership cooperation and autonomy.

The authors argue that a comparison of secondary schools based exclusively on university acceptance rates or other direct measures of study achievements might be misleading, given that such approaches ignore many aspects related to the educational process, such as differences in the level of non-cognitive skills of students, family background, overall living standards in a region, and the specific focus of the given secondary school. The authors derive novel indirect measures of grammar school efficiency that take into account relative demands for university study programmes. Relying on high-quality panel data that cover the period 2000-2004, and using the stochastic frontier methodology commonly applied in efficiency evaluation in a wide number of sectors, including education, the study also argues that the divergence between selected direct measures of school performance and indirect indicators has been increasing over time.","Klíčová slova: education, secondary education, performance evaluation, technical efficiency"

It has two basic objectives. The first is to assess the dependence of work-life balance on economic conditions and the character of the given welfare/family regime. The second is to evaluate how much work-life balance is influenced by private-life determinants and how much by external, that is, structural and institutional, factors. The analysis is based on a comparison of the situation in the Czech Republic with selected countries. Success at achieving a work-life balance is examined both from a subjective perspective and in relation to the three basic social goals it is intended to facilitate: women's employment, people's reproductive plans, and gender equality. An international comparison shows that while the forms and success of harmonising family and professional roles in countries with different external factors have specific national features, people's subjective assessments of their ability to combine these two spheres of activity vary little among economically active partners. The reason for this appears to be that to some extent people adapt (more or less voluntarily) their harmonisation strategies to the external conditions in individual countries. Also, these strategies are influenced by national socio-cultural specifics and differences in the degree of acceptance of gender inequalities.","Klíčová slova: work-life balance, employment, reproductive behaviour, gender equality, family regime"

First, it explores the variation in the level of political participation among post-communist states. Second, it deals with the differences in the determinants that account for political participation in individual countries. The second objective is met by introducing a three-dimensional explanatory model of political participation: individual resources, motivations, and social networks. In an empirical analysis political participation in nine post-communist countries is examined using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2004. Results show that the countries under study vary in the level of political participation both at the aggregate and individual levels. The most active citizens are in the former East Germany and Slovakia. Polish and Hungarian citizens participate in politics the least. Further, two modes of political participation - protest activity and contacting - are identified and used as dependent variables in further analysis. In the second part of the article, the explanatory model is tested against data from individual countries. The analysis shows that there is a difference in the factors that account for political participation in various post-communist countries. Generally, the three-level model of political participation works best in Hungary, Bulgaria, and East Germany. It explains very little variation in Russia and Poland.","Klíčová slova: political participation, post-communist countries, individual resources, political attitudes, social capital."

This article examines the question of why people actually want children and bases its answers on data from the 2006 Value of Children Survey, which reintroduces the value of children concept from the 1970s. The battery of survey questions used identified six dimensions of the value of children (The positives of parenthood; Natural drives and goals; Tradition and social status; Social pressure; Limitations and losses; and Decision inhibitors). The respondents, young people between the ages of 28 and 34, see the main reasons for deciding to have children in the positive feelings associated with raising children and with successful parenthood as a natural part of life. They associate parenthood less with responses about social norms and pressure or with rational considerations about all the pros and cons of having children, and they see parenthood as their own, individual decision. A data analysis based on a multinomial logistic regression shows that declared attitudes to a limited extent infl uence the preferred number of children and that the Czech population is still dominated by the idea of the two-child family with two biological parents, while declared voluntary childlessness is still a marginal phenomenon.","Klíčová slova: fertility, value of children, natal preferences, parenthood, Czech Republic."

Single-country analyses conducted to date on the Czech Republic have reached conflicting results both on the development of educational inequalities since the fall of socialism and on the weight of the factors behind those inequalities. Also, no international comparison has been conducted. Thus, the authors pursue two new directions of inquiry: 1) an international comparison, and 2) an update of the development of inequalities in all the mentioned countries since 2002. The authors used multi-dimensional statistical methods (logit models and a log-linear analysis) and the most recent available international data from the European Social Survey. The results revealed that out of all the countries studied it is in the Czech Republic that access to tertiary education is currently determined most by the cultural component of social background (the father's education). The country closest to the Czech Republic in this regard is Switzerland. The educational status of the family is also a crucial factor in educational reproduction in Sweden. Paradoxically, in the countries that historically and geographically are closest to the Czech Republic, namely, Poland and Germany, the crucial determinant in the transmission of educational status is the father's class.","Klíčová slova: educational reproduction, educational inequalities, Czech Republic."

The relative position of Prague in this region is then assessed in a cross-national comparison and determined to be specific. The article's main objective is to uncover the main demand factors behind the high prices and the low affordability of owner-occupied housing in Prague. The authors focus on factors that derive from the specific economic position of Prague and the specific culturally-rooted preferences of Czech citizens for owner-occupied housing. Findings from numerous sociological studies and experiments have proved both of these factors to be very important, and their future development will thus largely be influenced by the affordability of housing in Prague.","Klíčová slova: housing affordability, house prices, housing demand."

Although the student financial aid system is just one of a number of factors that influence a person's chances of studying in higher education, its role in a person's decision to pursue higher education may be of fundamental significance for those with lower socio-economic status. Therefore, the authors of this article focus on the effect of the financial conditions of study on the chances that individuals from families with low socio-economic status have obtained higher education. The analysis looks at developments in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, because Czech and Dutch student financial aid systems have been evolving in very different directions over the last two decades, while their secondary school systems continue to share very similar features. The analysis reveals that student financial aid based primarily on direct financial support (as in the Netherlands) was accompanied by a decline in inequalities in access to education, even though students had to pay tuition, while a system of financial aid primarily involving indirect support (as in the Czech Republic) applied over the same period did not inhibit increasing inequalities, despite the fact that during the period under observation students were not required to pay tuition.","Klíčová slova: higher education, accessibility, inequality, student financial aid, Czech Republic, Netherlands."

His battle against the idea of a politically and morally neutral understanding of social inquiry was rhetorically compelling and anticipated the radical voices that would be heard in the late 1960s. It is argued in this article that probably the best lesson we can get from Mills has to do with his understanding of 'sociology as a profession'. His argument addresses crucially important questions about the public relevance of social inquiry and the underlying themes of social-scientific reflexivity, creativity, and non-conformity. However, despite his rhetorical force and stylistic brilliance, Mills' overall message is considered ambivalent. His concept of social inquiry based on identification of morally and politically relevant problems ultimately leads to the vaporisation of the very substance of social inquiry and to the institutional debilitation of the field as such. The resulting uncertainty concerning the basic means and ends of sociology, together with a hyper-tolerance towards the delineation of sociological research area, often leads to the identifi cation of relevant problems on the basis of individual choice, inspiration, creativity, or imagination. It is suggested that this understanding of Mills' legacy usually results in the trivialisation and parody of the overall message embodied in The Sociological Imagination.","Klíčová slova: imagination, creativity, identification of problems, value-neutrality, morally committed social inquiry."

To examine how research on women in science and research on gender and science relate to each other, some feminist epistemological perspectives, mainly feminist contextual empiricism, are used in order to show how the feminist philosophical conceptual framework may be useful for understanding the problems currently faced by women in science. After reflecting and elaborating on the very thesis of gendered science, the author analyses in more detail the concept of epistemic communities and the concept of trust as an epistemic factor. Through these concepts the author argues that philosophical/ epistemological considerations are fruitful for studying the experience of individual women in science. Both of these interrelated concepts are considered highly relevant in the search for an epistemological framework facilitating the thematic study of women in science on a theoretical level and research on the current situation of women in the academic world in Slovakia.","Klíčová slova: feminist epistemologies, gendered science, epistemic communities, trust, equal opportunities, Slovakia."

Unlike homosexuality in the 20th century, the same-sex relationships between women in the 19th century often enjoyed social recognition and some women in female marriages occupied prominent social positions. Because they were considered to rest on contract, female marriages served as inspiration for the contractual view of marriage advocated by many supporters of the Victorian marriage reform. The contribution of women in female couples to the success of the marriage reform was further underlined by their belonging to influential social networks. The author also argues that while the structuralist anthropology of mid-20th century, represented through the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, had limited understanding of homosexuality as a socially legitimate phenomenon, the Victorian anthropology of the second half of the 19th century was relatively more open regarding the same-sex relationships. It is contended that authors as diverse as Henry Maine, Johann Bachofen, or Frederick Engels provided impulses in their work both for a positive evaluation of the same-sex relationships and for a more egalitarian understanding of marriage.","Klíčová slova: female marriages, social history of marriage, GLBT studies, Victorian studies, social anthropology - history of."

It then presents the results of three quantitative analyses of secondary data. The objective is to help facilitate a complex understanding of the mechanisms of the reproduction of gendered social structures. The genderedness of the social institutions in the education system and the labour market in relation to the socialising trends in the family is described in three parts: 1) gender segregation in employment in the context of segregation in education - the author shows that the horizontal dimension of these social institutions plays a more significant role than the vertical dimension; 2) the factors that condition girls' and boys' educational aspirations and choice of schools - the author demonstrates how secondary school choices are gendered (though the analysis did not reveal the differences between the factors that infl uence girls' and boys' aspirations); 3) the factors that condition parents' educational and class aspirations for their sons and daughters - the author uncovers several aspects of the socialising effect of the reproduction of the two traditional career trajectories based on gender. In conclusion, the article answers the question of how structurally gendered expectations cohere with individual career trajectories, and based on the three analyses formulates questions for further research and offers a revised theoretical conceptualisation of gender as an analytical category.","Klíčová slova: gendered social structures, labour market segregation, educational aspirations, educational choice, gender and education, Czech Republic."

In this analysis, gender is conceived as a principle manifested in interactions, a principle that structures the lives of individuals and the collective, and not as a complex of essential characteristics of an individual. Gender is analysed in relation to other categories like age and ethnicity. These represent additional re/constructed categories that influence social inequality. These categories tend to be viewed as natural sources of social difference and the legitimisation of inequalities. An analysis of the ways in which these categories are activated in the social field makes it possible to go beyond the boundaries of research on the reification of these categories. In this article, the author shows how these categories intertwine and connect and how the interplay between them is manifested in the behaviour and strategies of various actors, i.e. students, in the classroom.","Klíčová slova: gender, ethnicity, age, inequality, ethnography, school, Czech Republic."

Strategie obživy osamělých matek v ČR,Radka Dudová,"Sociologický ústav AV ČR, v.v.i., Praha","When examining the gender of institutions of parenthood, lone motherhood is a key issue. In this article the author focuses on the economic implications of lone motherhood and on the strategies that women living with children without a partner develop in order to ensure their livelihood. The author begins by presenting the theoretical background and some results from European and North American research on lone motherhood. She then provides an overview of research on lone parenthood done in the Czech Republic since 1959. Finally, the author describes the qualitative study she conducted on divorced mothers. The results show how women deal economically with marital separation and which livelihood strategies they opt for. The research methodology was based on constructivist grounded theory and the technique of interviews. From the research results the author distinguishes five basic strategies that can be combined and that are based on the sources that women have at their disposal. Those strategies may differ in terms of their degree of success, dependence/independence on others, and their efficacy at different points in time. The results also indicate that the success of these working strategies depends mainly on the age of the youngest child in the family and the caring responsibilities required by that age. The author argues that while for some women heading one-parent families paid work is an option that allows them to obtain a certain degree of independence and self-confidence, its efficacy depends on the context and immediate conditions in which the women find themselves. Overstressing the employment of lone mothers as a universal solution may thus lead to new dependencies.","Klíčová slova: lone mothers, poverty, work, divorce, gender, Czech Republic."

The article then moves on to describe policy frame analysis as an approach to analysing the way in which the gender inequalities addressed by these actors are politically problematised in three policy documents connected to the European Commission's 'Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010'. The analysis focuses on the main frames in these documents that legitimise the existence of an independent policy field concerned with gender equality at the EU level and discusses the ramifications of these frames for the promotion of gender equality; for example, how certain policy measures might lead to different outcomes when promoted within different frames.","Klíčová slova: gender equality policies, frame analysis, transnational advocacy networks, cooptation, agenda setting, European Union."

In the theoretical part of the article the author gives evidence of the constructed nature of the philosophical canon, which in the Euro-American space is clearly androcentric. She summarises criticism to date of the philosophical canon by feminist historians of philosophy and describes the results of their research, which is directed at several areas: uncovering forgotten women philosophers of the past; analysing philosophers' views on gender; identifying the genderedness of basic philosophical categories; criticising the dualism that characterises modern philosophical discourse; and finally, making various reinterpretations of the concepts of past philosophers. Each of these approaches has particular potential and limitations, which the author seeks to identify. In the second part of the article the author presents the results of her analysis of philosophy textbooks and books on the history of philosophy published in the Czech Republic after 1990. She conducted her analysis by comparing information on women philosophers contained in the texts of the selected books with the information available in other literature (mainly English). She also employed the typological method, and she identified five 'strategies' of marginalisation of women philosophers, whereby textbooks used at Czech universities contribute to maintaining the existing philosophical canon.","Klíčová slova: philosophical canon, feminist critique, women philosophers, philosophy - teaching of, feminist history of philosophy, Czech Republic."

Smith,"Institute of Sociology AS CR, Prague","This article compares the determinants of political participation, from voting and signing petitions to boycotting, across 23 European countries, posing the question whether and to what degree social inequalities in political participation differ between post-communist and Western countries. The data for the analysis is from the second round of the ESS survey, conducted in 2004-2005. The analysis focuses on the role of education, occupation, and gender in shaping the chances of engaging in political action, while also controlling for a range of sociological, political, and demographic variables. Interaction effects between individual variables and a post-communist dummy variable are used to directly compare the statistical significance of the difference in coefficients between post-communist and Western countries. The article finds that the observed effects of the post-communist context are actually accounted for by the indirect effects of a number of individual-level variables. In particular, education, occupation, and gender have stronger effects in post-communist countries than Western countries on many forms of political participation; in other words, the post-communist countries exhibit somewhat larger inequalities in political participation than in the West.","Klíčová slova: : political participation, political behaviour, social inequality, social stratification, post-communism"

The research draws on three case studies comparing pairs of companies active in the Czech Republic and in one of the following countries - Germany, France, and Sweden - in the field of engineering. The goal is to explore in depth the conditions that Czech working parents are faced with and that derive from the organisational processes and means and dynamics of negotiating conditions for working parents, and to compare them with the conditions in other countries and identify the sources of variability of these conditions. Important differences between a company's family-friendly practices in its home country and in its Czech branches are primarily determined by the differences in the way in which welfare regimes are set up in individual countries. In addition, the authors identify the following five main interlinked factors explaining the variability of family-friendly policies and practices in organisations: parental (maternity) ideologies, the organisational culture of non-discrimination and equal opportunities, the actors' activity in work relations, the role of trade unions in negotiations, and the given organisation's experience with employees-parents.","Klíčová slova: : organisations, family-friendly policies, work, gender"

And because Poland is a relatively new member of the EU, the article also develops the argument that such a reversal in the new member countries could make the European Union's (EU) acquis irrelevant for further democratisation. Therefore, the article first explains how the failure of the economic liberalism of the neo-liberal market economy paves the way for the success of conservative political parties. It then raises the question of why political liberalism, promoted by the EU's human rights acquis, is also a target for the opponents of the market economy. The article concludes with a discussion of current Polish politics in the aftermath of the October 2007 elections.","Klíčová slova: : liberalism, Poland, PiS, EU, human rights"

This study looks at the manifestations of this concept in Germany, where politics and society are still confronted with the legacy of Nazism. The author sets out to examine whether no-go-areas actually exist in Germany, and if they do, to look at how life in them is organised, how they are accepted by majority society, and how these activities are supported (or initiated) by the NPD, a German right-wing extremist party. In the region of former East Germany in particular there has been an increase in support for neo-Nazism as an extreme reaction to the deteriorating economic and social situation. Studies have shown that in this region more and more citizens are sinking into the 'modernisation trap', and as a result right-wing extremism and neo-Nazism are gaining more and more ground. One way in which the extreme right-wing NPD and related or subordinate 'friendly' organisations want to 'control the streets', and thereby also the public, is through the establishment of 'no-goareas', which are areas dominated by neo-Nazis. The objective is to create a zone for neo-Nazi sympathisers, chase out foreigners and co-citizens who do not share extremist views, and work towards achieving the ultimate goal: destroying democracy and establishing the 'Fourth Reich'.","Klíčová slova: : right-wing extremism, nationalism, racism, no-go-area, Germany"

From the perspective of the cognitive aspects of survey methodology the article takes a complex view of this situation and applies theoretical concepts and empirical evidence in order to explain the close connection between the interview situation and the quality of the information obtained. The interview situation is portrayed in its twofold form: personal aspects (the mental operations of respondents) and social aspects (the interaction and communication between the interviewer and the respondent). The analysis of the interactive aspects of the interview situation draws attention to the rules of standard communication, which interfere with the ordinary concept of the standardised interview and the course of mental processes. The cognitive aspect of responding to questions is analysed from the perspective of the wider understanding of context effects, the author refers to the most important theoretical concepts relating to individual effects and empirical evidence of some effects that influence the response process. The article takes a somewhat untypical approach to some aspects of data collection in questionnaire surveys and into the Czech context introduces the cognitive aspects of the methodology of questionnaire surveys.","Klíčová slova: survey interview, survey methodology, questionnaire, CASM, sociological methodology."

The concept of 'care as a labour of love' (Graham) is contrasted with the concept of the 'defamilisation of care' (Glenn) and 'social rights for elderly care' (Fine). The author finds that more demanding family care, measured as the level of IADL or BADL, is reflected in a growing number of hours spent on family care. The author shows the significant differences in the psychological and financial burden experienced by primary caregivers in relation to how demanding the level of care required is. The article presents evidence of the existence of 'collective family care' in situations where demanding personal care for a senior is required. The participation of other family members in providing care for a senior in situations of demanding personal care demonstrates some features of family cohesion.","Klíčová slova: BADL, IADL, family care, seniors, family solidarity, social cohesion, Czech Republic."

Using data from the survey 'Marriage, Work, Family' the objective of this analysis is to identify the attitudes that Czech men and women maintain towards various strategies for overcoming infertility (adoption, different forms of assisted reproduction) and the factors that infl uence and shape these attitudes. The first part of the analysis looks for the determinants behind attitudes towards adoption and assisted reproduction in the respondent's external characteristics. For example, education and religion were found to have a signifi cant influence. More educated respondents are more open to methods of assisted reproduction; religious respondents are more open to adoption. In terms of inner determinants (the respondent's attitude patterns) the authors, building on the preference theory proposed by Catherine Hakim, found a preference effect among women. The findings are seemingly paradoxical: of three groups of women (work-centred, home-centred, and adaptive) it is work-centred women (and the partners of work-centred women) who are most likely to take various infertility strategies into consideration. The third part of the analysis - an analysis of the external determinants of attitudes towards infertility strategies - revealed that in some cases attitudes are influenced by the characteristics of the partner more than by the respondent's own characteristics - in particular, the woman's attitudes are shaped more by the characteristics of her partner than by her own characteristics.","Klíčová slova: infertility, solutions to infertility, adoption, assisted reproduction, parenthood, Czech Republic."

Mobility trends in the intergenerational transmission of educational status identified in an analysis are presented in the context of findings on odds ratios in education and in a historical context. The analysis is based on observations of the intergenerational transmission of educational status, i.e. educational mobility, in two educational transitions between three educational levels (lower secondary, upper secondary, and higher education). Mobility tables and their log-linear analysis are used to help explain what mobility processes shape the educational inequalities that have proved stable over the long term and also odds ratios between the main levels of education. The article helps fill in the gap in knowledge about the long-term development of the educational structure in the historical Czech Lands and Czechoslovakia and provides information about typical mobility trajectories and varying mobility patterns in periods before 1948, between 1948 and 1989, and after 1989. An understanding of these structural contexts helps clarify what occurred in the past and what is occurring now in the area of unequal access to education and to explain one of the main findings from the analysis - that in Czech society the transmission of a family's educational status from one generation to the next continuously follows the same patterns.","Klíčová slova: access to education, educational mobility, educational inequality, sociology of education, Czech Republic."

Owing to the absence of useful aggregate data on incomes and expenditures for different household types in the regions of the Czech Republic, the authors created their own simulation methodology for measuring housing affordability, which uses available regional wage statistics and data on market rents. The results indicate that the general risk of being unable to afford rental housing and regional differences in housing affordability are both decreasing, but there is still a relatively large group of households that under current wage conditions for paying social benefits would be unable to afford to pay market rents.","Klíčová slova: housing affordability, rental housing, social exclusion, Czech Republic."

The author shows that a prominent role in such processes is played by psychological essentialism. People represent some of their social identities as inherent qualities that are based on the sharing of a presumed 'essence': something unobservable, diffi cult to remove, irreversible, and causally responsible for overt behaviours. Empirical evidence suggests that no particular causal process of essence acquisition is constitutive for essentialism in folk models of society. Some authors believe that folk essentialism is necessarily connected with the presumed innateness of an essence (its biological transmission across generations). Innate potential and biological inheritance, however powerful they may be for the human cognitive mind in the domain of folk models for biology, are far from necessary in essentialist folksociological classifications. Essentialism in folk sociology is not defined by any particular causal process of essence acquisition. Even when it is possible to detect that a given group of people claim the innate essence of a particular folk sociology, it is always necessary to look for other features of essentialism (inherence, sharp boundaries, the immutability of identity, etc.). The article reviews some infl uential cognitive proposals concerning folk models of society (Astuti, Gil-White, Hirschfeld) and ethnicity, and provides arguments and empirical evidence collected in Western Ukraine in support of the claim that presumed innateness is not the constitutive part of folk models of society, let alone of psychological essentialism.","Klíčová slova: essentialism, folk models of society, ethnicity, Ukraine, social identity."

Gender inequalities as well as inequalities that are based on other social categories, such as class, ethnicity, nationality, geopolitical location, marital status, and so on are incorporated in the social organisation of care which retrospectively reinforces them. Feminist debate has thus far formulated demands for the recognition of caring persons mainly at the national level, but the author of the article, referring to Arlie Hochschild and Allison Weir, shows that the current challenges of global capitalism point to the need to articulate these demands in a transnational context and to embed care in the discourse of transnational justice. She critically addresses the challenges that efforts to attain recognition for caring persons by including care as a labour-market activity are confronted with owing to the current changes in the social organisation of care under global capitalism, which involves among others the employment of marginalised groups of women and women immigrants in the caring professions. Drawing on the work of Nancy Fraser, the author formulates two normative criteria for reconceptualising care as a social engagement without subjecting it to the logic of market valuation.","Klíčová slova: care, gender, feminist theory, social justice, transnationalism."

They propose three integral dimensions of conceptualising the exercise of parenthood in Czech society in relation to gender equality in the labour market that co-determine the position of parents in the labour market. The authors analyse these dimensions using data from two representative sociological surveys. 1) The right to be a parent (to care for one's child) and the right to work: the measures provided in the Czech welfare state are based on the myth that there are two separate worlds of work and care in conformity with the gender principle, even though there are no significant differences between Czech men and women in terms of the value of work in their lives. 2) Equality or non-discrimination in parenthood: the right to work of mothers of young children is violated in the context of generally increasing gender inequalities in the labour market. 3) The opportunity to achieve a work/life balance: in Czech society flexible forms of employment are uncommon, working hours tend to have a fixed start and finish, or there is negative flexibility, which renders a work/life balance impossible. The way in which state policy defines and employers apply the conditions of parenthood in relation to the labour market and in the context of the gender structure of Czech society makes parenthood a significant handicap for the social inclusion of women who are mothers of young children in the Czech Republic.","Klíčová slova: gender equality, gender and labor market, work/life balance, parenthood, flexible forms of employment, Czech Republic."

Imperatív dobrej matky a participácia matiek maloletých detí na trhu práce,Michaela Potančoková,"INFOSTAT-VDC, Bratislava","Numerous studies have confirmed that caring for small children is still the domain of women in Slovakia. Maternity as such is considered the natural and expected role of women and is part of the construction of femininity in Slovak society. At the same time, it is expected and routine that Slovak women participate in the labour market, and the prevailing form of employment is full-time work. This complicates efforts to harmonise work with the need to care for a small child. It is not just the country's legislative and institutional framework that shape notions about caring for small children; they are also influenced by the views and attitudes of society towards this issue. The image of a good mother is constructed, and women then try to approximate it when performing their maternal role. The prevailing ideal is of a mother who devotes herself full-time to caring for a child for the first three years of the child's life. The author of this article focuses on the context surrounding the construction of the image of a good mother as one who cares for her child until the age of three, and examines how the image of the good mother is reflected in the opinions of women on returning to work and on work/life balance. The data in this analysis are drawn from public opinion polls about early childcare and the reality of caring for small children in Slovakia and from in-depth interviews with mothers of small children. The mothers are aware of the views of society, reflect on them, and many try to fulfil them so that they are perceived as 'good' and not 'inadequate' mothers.","Klíčová slova: motherhood, parenting, care for children, gender roles in family, Slovakia."

This article focuses on fathers who have accepted the modern norm of fatherhood and have played an active role by personally caring for their children, in particular, as primary carers during their period of parental leave. The entry of fathers into a sphere our culture has traditionally defined as belonging to women necessarily raises one basic question - 'What does the experience of caring for their children mean in the minds of fathers?' - which contains an entire series of other more specific questions: How do these men interpret fatherhood? Is the experience of caring for their children reflected in how these men construct gender identities and what does this mean from the perspective of the production of gender and gender relations? Interviews based on a prepared scenario were conducted on a sample of twenty families in which the father had taken parental leave, and the resulting data was analysed with the aid of grounded theory in an effort to answer the questions outlined above. Of particular interest in the analysis are the interpretative frameworks that the actors employ in their perception of experienced reality and to what outcome or how much applies the constructivist perspective of making gender, which permits a focus on the similarities and differences between men and women and within those categories. The findings contribute to the understanding of the construction of fatherhood in this group of fathers, of gender and gender relations, and of how gender stereotypes operate on the micro level of Czech society.","Klíčová slova: gender difference, gender similarity, gender in/equality, caring fatherhood, Czech Republic."

The main arguments of the study evolve around the themes of the (overwhelmingly positive) parental desires of the gay men participating in the study; their internalised moral dilemmas connected to gay fatherhood; the reproductive choices and limits that structure the attitudes of gay men towards parenthood and family; and gender stereotypes about family/parenting models and the roles these men occupy. The article is divided into two main parts. The fi rst part introduces the context and current state of sociological scholarship and research on gay fatherhood and homoparentality. The second part of the article discusses results, an interpretation, and an analysis of the empirical fi ndings of the study.","Klíčová slova: homosexuality, fatherhood, gay and lesbian parenthood, masculinity, family structure, Czech Republic."

The changes connected with the transformation of Czech society after 1989 affected their life courses. Instead of following the demographic behaviour of their mothers why do these women postpone motherhood to a later age or remain childless? What do the life courses and reproductive strategies of contemporary women over thirty look like? The qualitative research discussed in this article is based on in-depth interviews with primaparas over thirty and their childless peers conducted in order to examine the dynamics and character of their decision to become a mother. The research applied grounded theory and identified five different types of reproductive strategies: 'to have a child no matter what', 'to have a child with the right partner', 'waiting for the right time', 'hesitating over whether to have a child or not', 'not having a child'. Consequently the specific sources of these strategies were described. Background family experiences combined with the experiences from the period of childlessness in adulthood can lead to the development of an 'individualised habitus', which can block the transition to the motherhood phase. In the Czech context the development of an individualised habitus can be strengthened by the unequal distribution of gender roles in the family of origin as well as in partnerships in adulthood.","Klíčová slova: women over thirty, reproductive strategies, family and partnership, individualization, gender equity, Czech Republic."

It analyses the negotiations between partners confronted with the diagnosis of infertility and seeking the best solution. The analysis examined how men and women define their roles in the treatment of infertility, how they perceive their partners' coping and involvement, and conflicting and controversial topics and situations. Data suggest that the burden of infertility is unequal. While treatment involves a woman fully in the physical and the psychological sense, the involvement of the man and potential father in the treatment process is reduced to his provision of genetic material on demand. The research revealed two factors that influence and separate the experiences of men and women: the different time/age frame of the reproductive experience and the physical aspect of infertility and reproduction. Both factors are anchored in the praxis of assisted reproduction. The treatment process is administered in a way that, instead of reshaping or challenging traditional definitions of parenthood or gender roles, confirms the status quo.","Klíčová slova: infertility, gender roles, assisted reproduction, stigma, parenthood."
