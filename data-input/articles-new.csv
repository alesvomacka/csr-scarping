Fakulta sociálních studií, Masarykova univerzita, Brno","This study provides the first comprehensive introduction to exponential random graph models (ERGM) in the Czech academic literature. In it we apply ERGM to a network of 68 organisations involved in the Czech coal policy subsystem. First, we summarise the major limitations of the statistical modelling of network data arising from the interdependencies among observations and explain principled solutions to them provided by ERGM. Next, we discuss ERGM’s metatheoretical assumptions and their embeddedness within the broader context of social science research. We then introduce three types of relational mechanisms (endogenous, individual, and dyadic) operationalised as specific configurations, which we illustrate through the empirical example of an expert information network. Following a descriptive analysis we apply ERGM, breaking it down into three main steps: simulation, estimation, and estimation assessment. We provide a detailed interpretation of the model’s development and results, along with recommendations for building a model and solutions to convergence failure problems. One important finding is that one predictor of the exchange of expert information is ideological homophily, which reduces the potential of expertise to seek compromise solutions. We close with a discussion of the results and ERGM extensions to apply to more complex types of network data such as bipartite and multiplex networks and valued and longitudinal data.","Klíčová slova: social network analysis, exponential random graph models, political networks, social mechanisms, statistical models"

The aim of this study is to test the psychometric properties of the Czech version of the SWLS using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Item Response Theory (IRT) and to test its invariance between social groups in terms of gender, age, and education using Bayesian modelling on a representative sample of the Czech online population, as the scale has not yet been tested on representative data in the Czech Republic. The research sample consists of 960 respondents aged 18 to 69 years. The results confirmed that the psychometric properties of the Czech version of the SWLS are very good, but, at the same time, it is evident that the fifth item shows worse results than the other four items. In terms of dimensionality, CFA and IRT confirmed its modified single-factor structure with correlated residuals between the fourth and fifth items as the most appropriate. Testing for approximate measurement invariance using Bayesian modelling showed that the SWLS measures comparably between groups based on gender, age, and education. In conclusion, the Czech version of the SWLS is a suitable, verified, and reliable instrument for measuring the life satisfaction of Czech citizens.","Klíčová slova: SWLS, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), Item Response Theory (IRT), Bayesian modelling BSEM, psychometrics, measurement invariance"

The article also demonstrates how to specify a multilevel model when analysing contextual effects and it presents several types of random effects structures and options for centering explanatory variables in comparative longitudinal survey data. The contextual effect is decomposed into longitudinal and cross-sectional components for time-varying contextual variables, such as the labour force participation rate. The analysis of redistribution support based on ESS data from 27 countries and nine rounds shows how fundamentally the mentioned properties can influence substantive conclusions. The analyses presented in this article do not provide any evidence for a link between redistribution support and the labour force participation rate. However, the hypothetical configurations of multilevel models presented here cover all possible substantive effects of the labour force participation rate. Contextual effects analysis may thus lead to highly unreliable results when a multilevel model fails to control for the compositional effects of individual-level predictors, when it does not specify random effects at the level to which a substantial variation of the outcome variable may be attributed, and when it does not distinguish between the longitudinal and cross-sectional effects of time-varying variables.","Klíčová slova: multilevel models, contextual effects, redistribution support, random effects, centring variables, comparative longitudinal data"

Since the Czech Republic is one of the few countries with a strong centrist-populist party that has been in power, this article concentrates on the Czech case and compares this centrist-populist party to the largest right-wing populist party and the main non-populist parties. We argue that the centrist and rightist Czech populist parties have developed different types of welfare agendas. The centrist-populist party supports encompassing and universalist policies (which it links to economic efficiency and administrative improvements); in contrast, the right-wing populist party supports the protection of those in need while preserving the principles of merit and economic incentives.","Klíčová slova: Czech Republic, centrist populism, right-wing populism, welfare state, election programmes"

Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University, Prague","In the period from 2013 to 2017, the Czech Parliament passed five bills against corruption. A civil initiative called Reconstruction of the State was heavily involved in the process. Before the 2013 elections, the initiative prompted the candidates running for an MP mandate to publicly commit to supporting selected legislation proposals. The initiative used a variety of advocacy and campaign tactics to support passing the bills after the elections. This paper uses process tracing to answer the following research questions: (1) What path led to this success?, (2) Is there sufficient evidence about the actual role of the initiative in seeing the proposals passed by the Parliament? and (3) What has determined the initiative’s advocacy decisions? The first research question is treated descriptively, focusing on the key milestones in this historically unique advocacy campaign. To answer the second question, we conducted a non-formal counterfactual assessment of whether the absence of the initiative would have resulted in passing fewer proposals. This is important for evaluating civil society’s potential to effectively influence the political process. Finally, in answering the third question, we show that advocacy tactics have markedly changed throughout the Reconstruction of the State campaign. Building on this observation, we argue that tactics are not only policy- or campaign-specific but also change within a single case.","Klíčová slova: advocacy campaign, state capture, anti-corruption, transparency, civil society, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)"

NGOs Supported by the CEE Trust Are Still Largely Dependent on External Financing After 20 Years,Dalibor Jurášek ORCID...,"Faculty of Education, Trnava University in Trnava","Large-scale funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) by states and corporations (external funding) can impact their functioning and diminish their civic character. It is therefore of importance to understand whether and how NGOs can become financially independent of external funding. In Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), many NGOs were kickstarted by large sums from foreign state and corporate sponsors with the hopes of creating an independent civil society reliant on domestic sources: a ‘vibrant civil society’. However, did these NGOs become financially independent? This article examines a sample of 14 NGOs in Slovakia financed by the Trust for Civil Society in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE Trust), an organisation started by six private American foundations. Their funding is compared year by year, and it is found that between 2000 and 2020, foreign funding decreased from 97.2% to 55.2%, and corporate funding dropped from 92.1% to 31.2%. However, public sector funding increased from 1.2% to 35.6%. Civic funding remained low over the entire period, rising from 0.1% to 8.6%. Thus, external corporate funding was largely replaced by another type of external funding (public funding), and the role of one major foreign donor (the Trust) was largely replaced by another major foreign donor (European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) funds). The results suggest that it is difficult for NGOs kickstarted by external funding to achieve financial independence, at least on a timescale of 20 years.","Klíčová slova: civil society, non-governmental organisation funding, financial independence, civic funding, income diversification"

To obtain information on the main arguments for and against restitution, we selected two mainstream daily newspapers, the centre-right Lidové noviny and centre-left Právo, and the ‘official’ church media of the two largest churches seeking restitution in the Czech Republic: Katolický týdeník, the official paper of the Roman Catholic Church, and the monthly Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren magazine, Český bratr. All selected sources covered the 1990–2019 period. Our analysis of the media debate helps to determine why restitution in the Czech Republic – an interesting case given that it is perceived as the most atheistic country of the Visegrad Four – took its unique direction. It took more than twenty years for the churches to receive their relatively generous compensation and, at the same time, become separated from the state. Linking the theoretical concept of discursive depoliticisation with an argumentative analysis allows us to show that emphasis of the spiritual contribution of churches to society did not play a key supporting role in legitimising the restitution. The enactment of restitution was aided by two widely shared, morally oriented depoliticised sentiments: a neoliberal emphasis on private property and efficient management and an emphasis on the defence of constitutionality reinforced by anti-communist sentiments.","Klíčová slova: restitution of church property, argumentative discourse analysis, post-communism, Czech Republic"

We follow the development of Czech minimum-income scheme legislation from 2014 to 2021, after a series of neoliberal (workfarist) reforms reinforced the restrictive and controlling aspects of the system. The analysed period is characterised by the greater involvement of politicians representing the poorest regions of the Czech Republic and by calls for further restrictions. Analysing parliamentary debates from this period, we show that the delegitimised social system is no longer understood as a tool of social protection or even labour market inclusion; rather, it has become a tool of ethnic hierarchisation, which particularly resonates in the context of perceived socioeconomic insecurity. We propose the term ‘post-neoliberal ethnic welfare’ to describe this emerging system, which derives its legitimacy from neoliberal categories of deservingness and reduces social-protection systems into a performative tool of control over the Roma population.","Klíčová slova: welfare, Roma, neoliberalism, race, socially excluded localities"

Proceeding from the perspective of cultural sociology, it describes drought as a complex cultural field and a collective representation that has given rise to new forms of civic responsibility and subjectivity and a rich tableau of new uncertainties and risks. Based on an analysis of 4632 articles published in the most widely read Czech newspapers (Lidové noviny, Hospodářské noviny, MF Dnes, Právo, Blesk) between 2014 and 2018, the article identifies the key media images of drought and relates them to broader environmental discourses and cultural risk patterns. The main thesis of the article is that the key tension in the current debate on global climate change is a dispute not between supporters and deniers of climate change, but between climate fatalism and administrative-expert rationality. The article shows that the environmental crisis is closely linked to and negotiated and discussed in connection with the crisis of administrative and expert institutions. A good illustration of the cultural aspects of the current drought debate in the Czech Republic is the link between the social and natural aspects of environmental problems and the different imaginations of both nature and society.","Klíčová slova: environmental sociology, climate change, expertise, discourse analysis, culture codes, media"

However, the circumstances and consequences of both crises, as well as the ways they are dealt with, also share common features. The authors identify such contexts as reflected on blogging platforms by undertaking a qualitative analysis of texts from an interpretative phenomenological perspective.

This article focuses on a relatively less noticed aspect of climate-sceptic opinions in the presentation of this issue in the Czech media, namely doubts about the scientific knowledge on climate change expressed by scientists themselves. It is based on two basic observations. First, scientists and experts play a key role in the presentation of climate change. Second, highlighting the inconsistency of scientific reasoning and the uncertainty of science is one of the basic strategies of the climate-sceptic movement. The aim of this paper is to analyse the media coverage of two important Czech experts on climate change - Václav Cílek and Jan Pretel - and to determine whether they communicate the scientific uncertainty on this subject. The analysis shows a considerable number of doubts of various kinds in the articles of both of the two experts, which may have to do with the Czech public's circumspect attitude towards climate change and the slow change in their view of it.","Klíčová slova: climate change, media, popularisation, expert, climascepticism"

Particularly, we inquired to what extent Czech science is shared with the public on the Internet and what differences can be found between the websites of social and natural science institutions. Textual analysis revealed that on the scientific websites, terms like ‘science’ and ‘popularization’ occurred together with references to scientific institutions, study, and research. In the case of natural sciences, the term ‘popularization’ was more often linked to receiving science awards for science popularization and promotion. Structural web analysis showed that most scientific webs contained hyperlinks to social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Similarly, they often referred to online news outlets such as ceskatelevize.cz, novinky.cz, lidovky.cz, and rozhlas.cz.

Ethical political agency is the type of agency that transcends both the conception of institutions as dominant, taken-for-granted structures whose rules individuals tacitly follow, whereby they are deprived of agency, and the understanding of agency as a strategic activity that uses institutions to promote the specific interests of individuals. An analysis of the interactions between the candidates and the committee members, based on publicly available audiovisual recordings, shows that the candidates differed in their perceptions of their agency and its limits, but it was the public and dialogical arrangement of the hearings that shaped the conditions for the emergence of the specific image of ethical-political agency. This study thus grasps the public hearing as a form of institutional work that disrupts the notion that the relationship between the individual and the structure is invariable.

It focuses on exposing the ways in which asylum authorities/courts conceptually treat legal otherness on the basis of incomplete information in the practical context of asylum proceedings. It demonstrates how the judgments of Czech asylum courts deal with the legal differences of countries of origin in evidentiary interpretations of documents, such as transcripts of asylum interviews or country-of-origin information (COI), by reconstructing the conceptual frameworks in which the alterity of the origin countries’ state legal systems and customary law is embedded. It identifies particular evidentiary concepts that do not easily fit into the standard ontology of formal asylum law. In particular, Czech court rulings tend to conceptually frame unconventional legal authorities (like elders, traditional councils) as cultural entities, non-state actors, or private persons, which paradoxically disqualifies them from the ontological possibility of posing (or preventing) a threat to refugees by operating an (in)effective legal system. The article discusses the possibility of applying an alternative of legal-anthropological conceptualisation of unconventional legal authorities, focusing specifically on Afghanistan, Jordan, and Yemen.","Klíčová slova: asylum, evidence, refugee, legal anthropology, legal pluralism, non-state actors"

Our results unpack the narratives surrounding the EU and migration and highlight the apparent cleavage between the 'pro-immigrant' and 'anti-immigrant' discourses that underpin migration attitudes among the Czech public. We find that notwithstanding some divisiveness, there exists considerable convergence along the three dimensions of legitimacy: input, output and throughput. Indeed, both camps challenge EU legitimacy, but they do so for different reasons and focus on different dimensions. The output aspect of EU legitimacy is the most problematic and criticised within both types of discourse. The input dimension is problematic only within the 'anti-immigrant' discourse, and the throughput dimension of EU legitimacy is rather neglected within both discourses. In empirical terms, these findings imply that, in the eyes of the Czech public, the EU-even for those who accept it as a legitimate actor with regard to asylum and migration policy-fails to deliver satisfactory results.","Klíčová slova: EU attitudes, migration attitudes, legitimacy, cultural sociology, narratives"

It examines how governmentality and state superiority are represented and performed within the bureaucratic procedure of the application process. Based on the results, I argue that the application process bureaucracy is tied to time politics - practices that govern others through time. The paper is based on research realised in Brno, the second-largest city in the Czech Republic, and uses qualitative, ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews with immigrants from non-EU countries who applied for a long-term residence permit. The paper examines time politics within this process, highlighting its unpredictability, disrupted temporal linearity and chrononormativity. In this context, the respondents describe the waiting period as a moment of being in between - temporally, spatially and socially. Therefore, I argue that the time politics experienced throughout the application process significantly influences the lives of applicants. The interviews revealed that the applicants were caught in a liminal position with an uncertain ending, exemplified by the impossibility of moving (temporally, spatially and socially) - a feeling often described as stuckedness. Consequently, this time politics and the temporal inequality and disadvantages experienced during the process contribute to exclusion from mainstream Czech society and produce structural invisibility.","Klíčová slova: time politics, waiting, chrononormativity, bureaucracy, migration"

These attitudes have often been attributed to few contact opportunities with actual Muslims in the country and, thus, public overreliance on the highly negative representations of 'Muslims' in public discourse. However, empirical qualitative assessments of the stereotypes which guide many Czechs' anti-Muslim prejudice and the effects of intergroup contact have been neglected. In an epistemological shortcoming, the survey category 'Muslim' has often been treated as one of analysis rather than of practice. Contrarily, I argue that Czech participants' contingent understandings and racialisation of the category need to be reclaimed as the ontological basis of prejudice. In this study, I relied on the results of a larger constructionist thematic analysis of 31 semi-structured interviews with non-Muslim Czechs and, regardless of citizenship or ethnicity, Muslims living in Czechia conducted in 2020 and 2021. The results show that, in line with public discourse dynamics, 'Muslims' in Czechia are commonly understood as immigrants racialised through their perceived Arabness, Middle Easternness and non-Whiteness. Furthermore, perceptions of Western European 'Muslims' as highly conflictual are juxtaposed with the fragility of Czechia in the face of immigration. Against this backdrop, I examine the mechanisms through which intergroup contact enriches participants' social cognitions of 'Muslims' - namely, subgrouping, positive stereotyping, reduced perceived intergroup threat and anxiety, and (re-)humanisation.","Klíčová slova: Islamophobia, social cognition, intergroup contact, stereotypes, public opinion"

It explores how the city context shapes migration attitudes among residents, resulting in the formation of imagined communities of 'Locals' and 'Others'. Relying on qualitative research methods and cultural sociological theories of cultural armatures of the city, cultural repertoires, and symbolic boundaries, we examine the cases of two Czech cities, Teplice and Vyšší Brod. We find that the specific characteristics of the local history, geography, and demography of the cities give rise to distinct cultural repertoires that shape how their residents view migration and the presence of people with a migratory background in their city. We identify two prevailing cultural repertoires, local cosmopolitanism in Teplice and Czech nativism in Vyšší Brod, which inform both the patterns of boundary work towards residents with a migratory background and their positioning on local hierarchies of otherness. We argue that to understand the role of local context in the formation of migration attitudes, it is not sufficient to study only the characteristics of cities; how these characteristics are made meaningful by the people who live in them should also be considered.","Klíčová slova: migration attitudes, local turn, city context, cultural repertoires, symbolic boundaries"

Most of the building's inhabitants are Roma, but the problem of cultural racism is interconnected with political, economic, legal, and even research and activist issues. The article is based on socially committed ethnographic research and the perspective of critical human geography. The theoretical framework is informed by the geographies of eviction, which grasp evictions as a becoming affective process. In this approach the focus is on not just the structural and other causes of eviction and its negative consequences but also and above all on the eviction that is taking place in the present and that temporally goes beyond the act of displacement - it signifies the lasting effect of sovereign power exercised through threats of eviction and 'home unmaking' brought about by the withholding of vital infrastructure. The analysis distinguishes four becoming phases. The first one shows how tenants' precarity is made when their stigmatisation as Roma intersects with the neoliberal imperatives of individual responsibility asserted by the town. In the second phase, the eviction begins, giving rise to affects of confusion, desperation, and fear. The third phase brings resistance to the arbitrary sovereign power of the town authorities. In the fourth phase the resistance sees some successes, but the town's sovereign power at the same time expands its spatiality. The state of the eviction here is not final and it can still develop in different ways.","Klíčová slova: eviction, evictability, affect, sovereign power, tenants"

It at the same time seeks to refine the usage of the 'urban assemblages' concept in sociological and anthropological research. A Rapid Re-Housing project was piloted in Brno in 2016-2018. Its objective was to house 50 families in need of housing in municipal apartments and to provide social support in the form of intensive case management. The project included a randomised controlled trial and a qualitative evaluation. This research showed that the effects of the intervention were positive for the vast majority of indicators monitored, with some of the intervention families experiencing significant changes in their financial situation. Discussing the effects of the Brno 'housing first assemblage' we respond to to the reservations that have been voiced about the practice of housing First programmes. We base our responses here on empirical data and the concept of 'relations of exteriority' and show that even projects based on solving 'only one component' can initiate broader socio-material transformations of contemporary societies.","Klíčová slova: urban assemblages, families, homelessness, Housing First, randomised controlled trial"

In the Czech Republic, we recently identified the first efforts of some municipalities and smaller groups of citizens to transpose this 'housing innovation' into the Czech context, which until now has predominantly favoured individual owner-occupied housing. Considering that these emerging forms of housing in the Czech Republic have yet to be conceptualised in theory, the goal of our article is to initiate a debate on a more precise conceptual understanding. To this end, we propose an overarching definition of participatory housing, which we present using three defining principles and five dimensions of participation. Reflecting on existing Western European conceptualisations and a historical contextualisation of (related forms of) housing in the territory of what is today the Czech Republic, we discuss the specific dimensions of the concept of participatory housing, the conditions of its existence, and what makes it distinct from other forms of housing.","Klíčová slova: participatory housing, conceptual framework, collaborative housing, housing crisis, Czech Republic, historical contextualisation"

In the theoretical part, we explain the concepts of urban movements and tenant movements in Central and Eastern Europe and emphasise the role of everyday life and emotions in the genesis of a collective actor. We use qualitative methodology based on an analysis of 12 in-depth semi-structured interviews with members and one supporter of the Moje Pisnice Initiative. This initiative provides an illustration of the formation of collective actors in the urban space in Central and Eastern Europe. We focus specifically on the historical and social conditions behind the initiative's development and the emergence of a shared identity and shared housing expectations and the disappointment resulting from unfulfilled hopes. Other important factors that we discuss are the intersubjectivity of emotions and the emancipatory potential of the initiative's organisational structure, which enabled the participation of people with no prior experience with activism. We also focus on the public's sense of disillusionment with civic engagement and with the political system in general since 1989. This research contributes to the study of tenant movements in postsocialist countries, which are often an overlooked actor in one of the most important processes in the post-1989 transformation - privatisation. In contrast to previous research, we focus on the role of shared emotions and the subjective experience of historical processes.","Klíčová slova: urban movements, tenant movements, privatisation, emotions, CEE"

It explores the ‘marriage premium’, which refers to the advantage that children born to married parents have in comparison to other parental arrangements, and also highlights change in the ‘marriage premium’ after 1989. The analysis also examines the effect of marriage timing: Does the marriage premium differ between pre-birth and post-birth marriages? Did the effect of timing also change after 1989? The analysis is based on Czech GGS (Generations and Gender Survey) data from 2005. Direct marriages are the most stable unions, cohabitations are the least stable. Among couples who were not married, the odds of dissolution increased by 142 per cent (in comparison to marriages without pre-marital cohabitation). This ‘marriage premium’ increased after 1989. Marriage timing has come to play an increasingly important role. In the pre-1989 marriage cohort, pre-birth and post-birth marriage had the same stabilising effect. After 1989, however, pre-delivery wedding stabilises unions more than post-delivery legitimising marriages. We conclude that the era of highly individualised partnership choices has clearly shone a light on the consequences of these choices for subsequent union stability.","Klíčová slova: marriage, cohabitation, coresident partnership, union instability"

We also pose these questions separately for the public and private spheres, for selected industries, and for workplaces according to size. Throughout the monitored period, the GPG for equal work is around 10% and another roughly one-half of total GPG is caused by gender segregation. There has been a slight decrease since 2018, especially in workplaces with more than 5000 employees, where, however, the significance of women’s segregation into lower-paid positions is growing. The research confirmed that in more regulated, and therefore more transparent, contexts, such as the public sphere and in large workplaces (but also in small companies with up to 50 employees), the GPG for equal work is smaller than elsewhere. The results point to the need to systematically monitor the GPG and increase the transparency of remuneration systems in the workplace. In connection with the GPG, it will also be necessary to analyse the organisational processes that lead to women’s segregation into occupations, workplaces, and jobs that have lower wages, as well as the growing precarity of the Czech labour market.","Klíčová slova: gender wage gap, equal wage for equal work, gender segregation, wage transparency, linked employer–employee data"

It seeks to identify the factors that increase the chance that inhabitants of socially excluded localities (SELs) in Czechia will live in a hostel (a single room occupancy hotel). Do these factors indicate a higher intensity of social exclusion among people who live in hostels? Do hostels house the more disadvantaged segment of the disadvantaged population, such as the inhabitants of SELs? Our aim is to produce a more nuanced understanding of the different needs of the heterogeneous population of socially excluded localities, which can be used to implement socially inclusive measures. We analyse data obtained in a survey of the population of SELs. We apply binary logistic regression using socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of respondents and their households and variables measuring victimisation and respondents’ risk behaviour as predictors. Along with descriptive statistics we present the results of the simple and multiple binary logistic regressions. The multiple model revealed the following predictors to be statistically significant: the share of rent in household income, household size, residential mobility, citizenship, labour status, criminal activity not punished by imprisonment, nationality/ethnicity, and property victimisation of the household. Except for the last two, these factors increase the chance of socially disadvantaged persons living in a hostel.
